    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      A fast train drew into Albany, on the New York Central, from the West. It
      was three-thirty of a chill March morning in the first year of peace. A
      pall of fog lay over the world so heavy that it beaded the face and hands
      and deposited a fairy diamond dust upon wool. The station lights had the
      visibility of stars, and like the stars were without refulgence&mdash;a
      pale golden aureola, perhaps three feet in diameter, and beyond, nothing.
      The few passengers who alighted and the train itself had the same
      nebulosity of drab fish in a dim aquarium.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the passengers to detrain was a man in a long black coat. The high
      collar was up. The man wore a derby hat, well down upon his head, after
      the English mode. An English kitbag, battered and scarred, swung heavily
      from his hand. He immediately strode for the station wall and stood with
      his back to it. He was almost invisible. He remained motionless until the
      other detrained passengers swam past, until the red tail lights of the
      last coach vanished into the deeps; then he rushed for the exit to the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away toward the far end of the platform there appeared a shadowy patch in
      the fog. It grew and presently took upon itself the shape of a man. For
      one so short and squat and thick his legs possessed remarkable agility,
      for he reached the street just as the other man stopped at the side of a
      taxicab.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fool! As if such a movement had not been anticipated. Sixteen thousand
      miles, always eastward, on horses, camels, donkeys, trains, and ships;
      down China to the sea, over that to San Francisco, thence across this
      bewildering stretch of cities and plains called the United States, always
      and ever toward New York&mdash;and the fool thought he could escape!
      Thought he was flying, when in truth he was being driven toward a wall in
      which there would be no breach! Behind and in front the net was closing.
      Up to this hour he had been extremely clever in avoiding contact. This was
      his first stupid act&mdash;thought the fog would serve as an impenetrable
      cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the other man reached into the taxicab and awoke the sleeping
      chauffeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hotel,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Two dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we arrive. No; I'll take the bag inside with me.&rdquo; Inside the cab the
      fare chuckled. For those who fished there would be no fish in the net.
      This fog&mdash;like a kindly hand reaching down from heaven!
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later the taxicab drew up in front of a hotel. The unknown
      stepped out, took a leather purse from his pocket and carefully counted
      out in silver two dollars and twenty cents, which he poured into the
      chauffeur's palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an American?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! I was born in this burg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea of being an American?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say yes! This is one grand little gob o' mud, believe me! It's
      going to be dry in a little while, and then it will be some grand little
      old brick. Say, let me give you a tip! The gas in this joint is extra if
      you blow it out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grinning, the chauffeur threw on the power and wheeled away into the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      His late fare followed the vehicle with his gaze until it reached the
      vanishing point, then he laughed. An American cockney! He turned and
      entered the hotel. He marched resolutely up to the desk and roused the
      sleeping clerk, who swung round the register. The unknown without
      hesitance inscribed his name, which was John Hawksley. But he hesitated
      the fraction of a second before adding his place of residence&mdash;London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A room with a bath, if you please; second flight. Have the man call me at
      seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Here, boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sleepily the bellboy lifted the battered kitbag and led the way to the
      elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bawth!&rdquo; said the night clerk, as the elevator door slithered to the
      latch. &ldquo;Bawth! The old dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned to his chair, hoping that he would not be disturbed again
      until he was relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do we care, so long as we don't know? What's the stranger to us but a
      fleeting shadow? The Odysseys that pass us every day, and we none the
      wiser!
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk had not properly floated away into dreams when he was again
      roused. Resentfully he opened his eyes. A huge fist covered with a fell of
      black hair rose and fell. Attached to this fist was an arm, and joined to
      that were enormous shoulders. The clerk's trailing, sleep-befogged glance
      paused when it reached the newcomer's face. The jaws and cheeks and upper
      lip were blue-black with a beard that required extra-tempered razors once
      a day. Black eyes that burned like opals, a bullet-shaped head well
      cropped, and a pudgy nose broad in the nostrils. Because this second
      arrival wore his hat well forward the clerk was not able to discern the
      pinched forehead of the fanatic. Not wholly unpleasant, not particularly
      agreeable; the sort of individual one preferred to walk round rather than
      bump into. The clerk offered the register, and the squat man scratched his
      name impatiently, grabbed the extended key, and trotted to the elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; mused the clerk, &ldquo;we have with us Mr. Poppy&mdash;Popo&mdash;&rdquo; He
      stared at the signature close up. &ldquo;Hanged if I can make it out! It looks
      like some new brand of soft drink we'll be having after July first. Greek
      or Bulgarian. Anyhow, he didn't awsk for a bawth. Looks as if he needed
      one, too. Here, boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a peek at this John Hancock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee! That must be the guy who makes that drugstore drink&mdash;Boolzac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk swung out, but missed the boy's head by a hair. The boy stood
      off, grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you ast me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. If anybody else comes in tell 'em we're full up. I'll be a
      wreck to-morrow without my usual beauty sleep.&rdquo; The clerk dropped into his
      chair again and elevated his feet to the radiator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want me t' git a pillow for yuh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No back talk!&rdquo;&mdash;drowsily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! boy, but I got one on you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Boolzac guy didn't have no baggage, and yuh give 'im the key without
      little ol' three-per in advance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No grip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nix. Not a toot'brush in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the damage is done. I might as well go to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not premeditated on the part of the clerk to give the squat man the
      room adjoining that of Hawksley's. The key had been nearest his hand. But
      the squat man trembled with excitement when he noted that it was stamped
      214. He had taken particular pains to search the register for Hawksley's
      number before rousing the clerk. He hadn't counted on any such luck as
      this. His idea had been merely to watch the door of Room 212.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the feline foot, as they say. He moved about lightly and without
      sound in the dark. Almost at once he approached one of the two doors and
      put his ear to the panel. Running water. The fool had time to take a bath!
    </p>
    <p>
      A plan flashed into his head. Why not end the affair here and now, and
      reap the glory for himself? What mattered the net if the fish swam into
      your hand? Wasn't this particularly his affair? It was the end, not the
      means. A close touch in Hong-Kong, but the fool had slipped away. But
      there, in the next room, assured that he had escaped&mdash;it would be
      easy. The squat man tiptoed to the window. Luck of luck, there was a
      fire-escape platform! He would let half an hour pass, then he would act.
      The ape, with his British mannerisms! Death to the breed, root and branch!
      He sat down to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of the wall the bather finished his ablutions. His body
      was graceful, vigorous, and youthful, tinted a golden bronze. His nose was
      hawky; his eyes a Latin brown, alert and roving, though there was a hint
      of weariness in them, the pressure of long, racking hours of ceaseless
      vigilance. His top hair was a glossy black inclined to curl; but the four
      days' growth of beard was as blond as a ripe chestnut burr. In spite of
      this mark of vagabondage there were elements of beauty in the face. The
      expanse of the brow and the shape of the head were intellectual. The mouth
      was pleasure-loving, but the nose and the jaw neutralized this.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had towelled himself he reached down for a brown leather pouch
      which lay on the three-legged bathroom stool. It was patently a tobacco
      pouch, but there was evidently something inside more precious than
      Saloniki. He held the pouch on his palm and stared at it as if it
      contained some jinn clamouring to be let out. Presently he broke away from
      this fascination and rocked his body, eyes closed&mdash;like a man
      suffering unremitting pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God's curse on them!&rdquo; he whispered, opening his eyes. He raised the pouch
      swiftly, as though he intended dashing it to the tiled floor; but his arm
      sank gently. After all, he would be a fool to destroy them. They were
      future bread and butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would soon have their equivalent in money&mdash;money that would bring
      back no terrible recollections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange that every so often, despite the horror, he had to take them out
      and gaze at them. He sat down upon the stool, spread a towel across his
      knees, and opened the pouch. He drew out a roll of cotton wool, which he
      unrolled across the towel. Flames! Blue flames, red, yellow, violet, and
      green&mdash;precious stones, many of them with histories that reached back
      into the dim centuries, histories of murder and loot and envy. The young
      man had imagination&mdash;perhaps too much of it. He saw the stones
      palpitating upon lovely white and brown bosoms; he saw bloody and greedy
      hands, the red sack of towns; he heard the screams of women and the
      raucous laughter of drunken men. Murder and loot.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the cotton wool lay two emeralds about the size of half
      dollars and half an inch in thickness, polished, and as vividly green as a
      dragonfly in the sun, fit for the turban of Schariar, spouse of
      Scheherazade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodin would have seized upon the young man's attitude&mdash;the limp body,
      the haggard face&mdash;hewn it out of marble and called it Conscience. The
      possessor of the stones held this attitude for three or four minutes. Then
      he rolled up the cotton wool, jammed it into the pouch, which he hung to
      his neck by a thong, and sprang to his feet. No more of this brooding; it
      was sapping his vitality; and he was not yet at his journey's end.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded to the bedroom, emptied the battered kitbag, and began to
      dress. He put on heavy tan walking shoes, gray woollen stockings, gray
      knickerbockers, gray flannel shirt, and a Norfolk jacket minus the third
      button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, that button! He fingered the loose threads which had aforetime snugged
      the button to the wool. The carelessness of a tailor had saved his life.
      Had that button held, his bones at this moment would be reposing on the
      hillside in far-away Hong-Kong. Evidently Fate had some definite plans
      regarding his future, else he would not be in this room, alive. But what
      plans? Why should Fate bother about him further? She had strained the
      orange to the last drop. Why protect the pulp? Perhaps she was only making
      sport of him, lulling him into the belief that eventually he might win
      through. One thing, she would never be able to twist his heart again. You
      cannot fill a cup with water beyond the brim. And God knew that his cup
      had been full and bitter and red.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand swept across his eyes as if to brush away the pictures suddenly
      conjured up. He must keep his thoughts off those things. There was a taint
      of madness in his blood, and several times he had sensed the brink at his
      feet. But God had been kind to him in one respect: The blood of his
      glorious mother predominated.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many were after him, and who? He had not been able to recognize the
      man that night in Hong-Kong. That was the fate of the pursued: one never
      dared pause to look back, while the pursuers had their man before them
      always. If only he could have broken through into Greece, England would
      have been easy. The only door open had been in the East. It seemed
      incredible that he should be standing in this room, but three hours from
      his goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      America! The land of the free and the brave! And the irony of it was that
      he must seek in America the only friends he had in the world. All the
      Englishmen he had known and loved were dead. He had never made friends
      with the French, though he loved France. In this country alone he might
      successfully lose himself and begin life anew. The British were British
      and the French were French; but in this magnificent America they possessed
      the tenacity of the one and the gayety of the other&mdash;these joyous,
      unconquered, speed-loving Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up the overcoat. Under the light it was no longer black but a very
      deep green. On both sleeves there were narrow bands of a still deeper
      green, indicating that gold or silver braid had once befrogged the cuffs.
      Inside, soft silky Persian lamb; and he ran his fingers over the fur
      thoughtfully. The coat was still impregnated with the strong odour of
      horse. He cast it aside, never to touch it again. From the discarded small
      coat he extracted a black wallet and opened it. That passport! He wondered
      if there existed another more cleverly forged. It would not have served an
      hour west of the Hindenburg Line; but in the East and here in America no
      one had questioned it. In San Francisco they had scarcely glanced at it,
      peace having come. Besides this passport the wallet contained a will, ten
      bonds, a custom appraiser's receipt and a sheaf of gold bills. The will,
      however, was perhaps one of the most astonishing documents conceivable. It
      left unreservedly to Capt. John Hawksley the contents of the wallet!
    </p>
    <p>
      Within three hours of his ultimate destination! He knew all about great
      cities. An hour after he left the train, if he so willed, he could lose
      himself for all time.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the bottom of the kitbag he dug up a blue velours case, which after a
      moment's hesitation he opened. Medals incrusted with precious stones; but
      on the top was the photograph of a charming girl, blonde as ripe wheat,
      and arrayed for the tennis court. It was this photograph he wanted.
      Indifferently he tossed the case upon the centre table, and it upset,
      sending the medals about with a ring and a tinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the next room heard this sound, and his eye roved desperately.
      Some way to peer into yonder room! But there was no transom, and he would
      not yet dare risk the fire escape. The young man raised the photograph to
      his lips and kissed it passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he hid it in the lining of his coat, there being a convenient rent in
      the inside pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not think!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I must not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He became the hunted man again. He turned a chair upend and placed it
      under the window. He tipped another in front of the door. On the threshold
      of the bathroom door he deposited the water carafe and the glasses. His
      bed was against the connecting door. No man would be able to enter
      unannounced. He had no intention of letting himself fall asleep. He would
      stretch out and rest. So he lit his pipe, banked the two pillows, switched
      out the light, and lay down. Only the intermittent glow of his pipe coal
      could be seen. Near the journey's end; and no more tight-rope walking,
      with death at both ends, and death staring up from below. Queer how the
      human being clung to life. What had he to live for? Nothing. So far as he
      was concerned, the world had come to an end. Sporting instinct; probably
      that was it; couldn't make up his mind to shuffle off this mortal coil
      until he had beaten his enemies. English university education had dulled
      the bite of his natural fatalism. To carry on for the sport of it; not to
      accept fate but to fight it.
    </p>
    <p>
      By chance his hand touched his spiky chin. Nevertheless, he would have to
      enter New York just as he was. He had left his razor in a Pullman washroom
      hurriedly one morning. He dared not risk a barber's chair, especially
      these American chairs, that stretched one out in a most helpless manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly his pipe sank toward his breast. The weary body was overcoming the
      will. A sound broke the pleasant spell. He sat up, tense. Someone had
      entered through the window and stumbled over the chair! Hawksley threw on
      the light.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the day clerk arrived the night clerk sleepily informed him that the
      guest in Room 214 was without baggage and had not paid in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lave a call?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I thought I'd put you wise. I didn't notice that the man had no grip
      until he was in the elevator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I'll send the bell-hop captain up with a fake call to see if
      the man's still there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the captain&mdash;late of the A.E.F. in France&mdash;returned to the
      office he was mildly excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee, there's been a whale of a scrap in Room 212. The chambermaid let me
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murder?&rdquo; whispered the clerks in unison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murder your granny! Naw! Just a fight between 212 and 214, because both
      of 'em have flown the roost. But take a peek at what I found on the
      table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a case of blue velours. The boy threw back the lid dramatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;War medals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they are I never piped 'em before. They ain't French or British.&rdquo; The
      captain of the bell-boys scratched his head ruminatively. &ldquo;Gee, I got it!
      Orders, that's what they all 'em. Kings pay 'em out Saturdays when the pay
      roll is nix. Will you pipe the diamonds and rubies? There's your room
      rents, monseer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day clerk, who considered himself a judge, was of the opinion that
      there were two or three thousand dollars tied up in the stones. It was a
      police affair. Some ambassador had been robbed, and the Britisher and the
      Greek or Bulgarian were mixed up in it. Loot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the war was over,&rdquo; said the night clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shootin' is over, that's all,&rdquo; said the captain of the bellboys,
      sagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had happened in Room 212? A duel of wits rather than of physical
      contact. Hawksley realized instantly that here was the crucial moment.
      Caught and overpowered, he was lost. If he shouted for help and it came,
      he was lost. Once the police took a hand in the affair, the newspaper
      publicity that would follow would result in the total ruin of all his
      hopes. There was only one chance&mdash;to finish this affair outside the
      hotel, in some fog-dimmed street. There leaped into his mind, obliquely
      and queerly, a picture in one of Victor Hugo's tales&mdash;Quasimodo. And
      there he stood, in every particular save the crooked back. And on the top
      of this came the recollection that he had seen the man before.... The
      torches! The red torches and the hobnailed boots!
    </p>
    <p>
      There began an odd game, a dancing match, which the young man led
      adroitly, always with his thought upon the open window. There would be no
      shooting; Quasimodo would not want the police either. Half a dozen times
      his fingers touched futilely the dancing master's coat. Back and forth
      across the room, over the bed, round the stand and chairs. Persistently,
      as if he understood the young man's manoeuvres, the squat individual kept
      to the window side of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      An inspiration brought the affair to an end. Hawksley snatched up the
      bedclothes and threw them as the ancient retiarius threw his net. He
      managed to win to the lower platform of the fire escape before Quasimodo
      emerged.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fourteen-foot drop to the street, and the man with the golden
      stubble on his chin and cheeks swung for a moment to gauge his landing.
      Quasimodo came after with the agility of an ape. The race down the street
      began with about a hundred yards in between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the hill they went, like phantoms. The distance did not widen. Bears
      will run amazingly fast and for a long while. The quarry cut into Pearl
      Street for a block, turned a corner, and soon vaguely espied the Hudson
      River. He made for this.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the mind of Quasimodo this flight had but one significance&mdash;he was
      dealing with an arrant coward; and he based his subsequent acts upon this
      premise, forgetting that brave men run when need says must. It would have
      surprised him exceedingly to learn that he was not driving, that he was
      being led. Hawksley wanted his enemy alone, where no one would see to
      interfere. Red torches and hobnailed boots! For once the two bloods,
      always more or less at war, merged in a common purpose&mdash;to kill this
      beast, to grind the face of him into pulp! Red torches and hobnailed
      boots!
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently one of the huge passenger boats, moored for the winter, loomed
      up through the fog; and toward this Hawksley directed his steps. He made a
      flying leap aboard and vanished round the deckhouse to the river side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quasimodo laughed as he followed. It was as if the tobacco pouch and the
      appraiser's receipt were in his own pocket; and broad rivers made capital
      graveyards. They two alone in the fog! He whirled round the deckhouse&mdash;and
      backed on his heels to get his balance. Directly in front, in a very
      understandable pose, was the intended victim, his jaw jutting, his eyelids
      narrowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quasimodo tried desperately to reach for his pistol; but a bolt of
      lightning stopped the action. There is something peculiar about a blow on
      the nose, a good blow. The Anglo-Saxon peoples alone possess the
      counterattack&mdash;a rush. To other peoples concentration of thought is
      impossible after the impact. Instinctively Quasimodo's hands flew to his
      face. He heard a laugh, mirthless and terrible. Before he could drop his
      hands from his face-blows, short and boring, from this side and from that,
      over and under. The squat man was brave enough; simply he did not know how
      to fight in this manner. He was accustomed to the use of steel and the
      hobnails on his boots. He struck wildly, swinging his arms like a Flemish
      mill in a brisk wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of his blows got home, but these provoked only sardonic laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wild with rage and pain he bored in. He had but one chance&mdash;to get
      this shadow in his gorilla-like arms. He lacked mental flexibility. An
      idea, getting into his head, stuck; it was not adjustable. Like an arrow
      sped from the bowstring, it had to fulfill its destiny. It never occurred
      to him to take to his heels, to get space between himself and this enemy
      he had so woefully underestimated. Ten feet, and he might have been able
      to whirl, draw his pistol, and end the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coup de grace came suddenly: a blow that caught Quasimodo full on the
      point of the jaw. He sagged and went sprawling upon his face. The victor
      turned him over and raised a heel.... No! He was neither Prussian nor
      Sudanese black. He was white; and white men did not stamp in the faces of
      fallen enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one thing a white man might do in such a case without
      disturbing the ethical, and he proceeded about it forthwith: Draw the
      devil's fangs; render him impotent for a few hours. He deliberately knelt
      on one of the outspread arms and calmly emptied the insensible man's
      pockets. He took everything&mdash;watch, money, passport, letters, pistol,
      keys&mdash;rose and dropped them into the river. He overlooked Quasimodo's
      belt, however. The Anglo-Saxon idea was top hole. His fists had saved his
      life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hawksley heard the panting of an engine and turned his head. Dimly he saw
      a giant bridge and a long drab train moving across it. He picked up the
      fallen man's cap and tried it on. Not a particularly good fit, but it
      would serve. He then trotted round the deckhouse to the street side,
      jumped to the wharf, and sucking the cracked knuckles of his right hand
      fell into a steady dogtrot which carried him to the station he had left so
      hopefully an hour and a half gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      An accommodation train eventually deposited him in Poughkeepsie, where he
      purchased a cap and a sturdy walking stick. The stubble on his chin and
      cheeks began to irritate him intensely, but he could not rid himself of
      the idea that a barber's chair would be inviting danger. He was now
      tolerably certain that from one end of the continent to the other his
      presence was known. His life and his property, they would be after both.
      Even now there might be men in this strange town seeking him. The closer
      he got to New York, the more active and wide-awake they would become.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked the streets, his glance constantly roving. But apparently no one
      paid the least attention to him. Finally he returned to the railway
      station; and at six o'clock that evening he left the platform of the 125th
      Street Station, and appraised covertly the men who accompanied him to the
      street. He felt assured that they were all Americans. Probably they were;
      but there are still some stray fools of American birth who cannot accept
      the great American doctrine as the only Ararat visible in this present
      flood. Perhaps one of these accompanied Hawksley to the street. Whatever
      he was, one had upon order met every south-going train since seven o'clock
      that morning, when Quasimodo, paying from the gold hidden in his belt, had
      sent forth the telegraphic alarm. The man hurried across the street and
      followed Hawksley by matching his steps. His business was merely to learn
      the other's destination and then to report.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the earth a tempest had been loosed; but Ariel did not ride it,
      Caliban did. The scythe of terror was harvesting a type; and the innocent
      were bending with the guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Hawksley felt young, revivified, free. He had arrived.
      Surmounting indescribable hazards and hardships he walked the pavement of
      New York. In an hour the mutable quicksands of a great city would swallow
      him forever. Free! He wanted to stroll about, peer into shop windows,
      watch the amazing electric signs, dally; but he still had much to
      accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      He searched for a telephone sign. It was necessary that he find one
      immediately. He had once spent six weeks in and about this marvellous
      city, and he had a vague recollection of the blue-and-white enamel signs.
      Shortly he found one. It was a pay station in the rear of a news and
      tobacco shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered a booth, but discovered that he had no five-cent pieces in his
      purse. He hurried out to the girl behind the cigar stand. She was
      exhibiting a box of cigars to a customer, who selected three, paid for
      them, and walked away. Hawksley, boiling with haste to have his affair
      done, flung a silver coin toward the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five-cent pieces!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take them with you or shall I send them?&rdquo; asked the girl,
      earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any particular kind of ribbon you want the box tied with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; repeated Hawksley, harried and bewildered. &ldquo;But I'm
      in a hurry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much of a hurry to leave out the bark when you ask a favour? I make
      change out of courtesy. And you all bark at me Nickel! Nickel! as if that
      was my job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand apologies!&rdquo;&mdash;contritely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don't make it any worse by suggesting a movie after supper. My mother
      never lets me go out after dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather fancy she's quite sensible. Still, you seem able to take care of
      yourself. I might suggest&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With that black eye? Nay, nay! I'll bet somebody's brother gave it to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Venus was not on that occasion in ascendancy. Thank you for the change.&rdquo;
       Hawksley swung on his heel and reentered the booth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great weariness oppressed him. A longing, almost irresistible, came to
      him to go out and cry aloud: &ldquo;Here I am! Kill me! I am tired and done!&rdquo;
       For he had recognized the purchaser of the cigars as one of the men who
      had left the 125th Street Station at the same time as he. He remembered
      distinctly that this man had been in a hurry. Perhaps the whole dizzy
      affair was reacting upon his imagination psychologically and turning
      harmless individuals into enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said a man's voice over the wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Rathbone there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Rathbone is with his regiment at Coblenz, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coblenz?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I do not expect his return until near midsummer, sir. Who is
      this talking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you opened a cable from Yokohama?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Hawksley!&rdquo; The voice became excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! You will come right away. I alone understand, sir. You will
      remember me when you see me. I'm the captain's butler, sir&mdash;Jenkins.
      He cabled back to give you the entire run of the house as long as you
      desired it. He advised me to notify you that he had also prepared his
      banker against your arrival. Have your luggage sent here at once, sir.
      Dinner will be at your convenience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley's body relaxed. A lump came into his throat. Here was a friend,
      anyhow, ready to serve him though he was thousands of miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he could trust himself to speak he said: &ldquo;Sorry. It will be
      impossible to accept the hospitality at present. I shall call in a few
      days, however, to establish my identity. Thank you. Good evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment, sir. I may have an important cable to transmit to you. It
      would be wise to leave me your address, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley hesitated a moment. After all, he could trust this perfect old
      servant, whom he remembered. He gave the address.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he came out of the booth the girl stretched forth an arm to detain him.
      He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry I spoke like that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I'm so tired! I've been on
      my feet all day, and everybody's been barking and growling; and if I'd
      taken in as many nickels as I've passed out in change the boss would be
      rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a dozen of those roses there.&rdquo; She sold flowers also. &ldquo;The pink
      ones. How much?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two-fifty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid down the money. &ldquo;Never mind the box. They are for you. Good
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl stared at the flowers as Ali Baba must have stared at the cask
      with rubies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;For nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes blurred. She never saw Hawksley again; but that was of no
      importance. She had a gentle deed to put away in the lavender of
      recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside Hawksley could see nothing of the man who had bought the cigars.
      At any rate, further dodging would be useless. He would go directly to his
      destination. Old Gregor had sent him a duplicate key to the apartment. He
      could hide there for a day or two; then visit Rathbone's banker at his
      residence in the night to establish his identity. Gregor could be trusted
      to carry the wallet and the pouch to the bank. Once these were walled in
      steel half the battle would be over. He would have nothing to guard
      thereafter but his life. He laughed brokenly. Nothing but the clothes he
      stood in. He never could claim the belongings he had been forced to leave
      in that hotel back yonder. But there was loyal old Gregor. Somebody would
      be honestly glad to see him. The poor old chap! Astonishing, but of late
      he was always thinking in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hailed the first free taxicab he saw, climbed in, and was driven
      downtown. He looked back constantly. Was he followed? There was no way of
      telling. The street was alive with vehicles tearing north and south, with
      frequent stoppage for the passage of those racing east and west. The
      destination of Hawksley's cab was an old-fashioned apartment house in
      Eightieth Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregor would have a meal ready; and it struck Hawksley forcibly that he
      was hungry, that he had not touched food since the night before. Gregor,
      valeting in a hotel, pressing coats and trousers and sewing on buttons!
      Groggy old world, wasn't it? Gregor, pressing the trousers of the hoi
      polloi! Gregor, who could have sent New York mad with that old
      Stradivarius of his! But Gregor was wise. Safety for him lay in obscurity;
      and what was more obscure than a hotel valet?
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not seek the elevator but mounted the first flight of stairs. He
      saw two doors, one on each side of the landing. He sought one, stooped and
      peered at the card over the bell. Conover. Gregor's was opposite. Having a
      key he did not knock but unlocked the door and stepped into the dark hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stefani Gregor?&rdquo; he called, joyously. &ldquo;Stefani, my old friend, it is I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence. But that was understandable. Either Gregor had not returned from
      his labours or he was out gathering the essentials for the evening meal.
      Judging from the variety of odours that swam the halls of this human
      warren many suppers were in the process of making, and the top flavour was
      garlic. He sniffed pleasurably. Not that the smell of garlic quickened his
      hunger. It merely sent his thought galloping backward a score of years. He
      saw Stefani Gregor and a small boy in mountain costume footing it sturdily
      along the dizzy goat paths of the rugged hills; saw the two sitting on
      some ruddy promontory and munching black bread rubbed with garlic.
      Ambrosia! His mother's horror, when she smelt his breath&mdash;as if
      garlic had not been one of her birthrights! His uncle, roaring out in his
      bull's voice that black bread and garlic were good for little boys'
      stomachs, and made the stuff of soldiers. Black bread and garlic and the
      Golden Age!
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had flooded the hall with light he began a tour of inspection.
      The rooms were rather bare but clean and orderly. Here and there were
      items that kept the homeland green in the recollection. He came to the
      bedroom last. He hesitated for a moment before opening the door. The
      lights told him why Gregor had not greeted his entering hail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overturned reading lamp, the broken chair, the letters and papers
      strewn about the floor, the rifled bureau drawers&mdash;these things spoke
      plainly enough. Gregor was a prisoner somewhere in this vast city; or he
      was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley stood motionless for a space. And he must remain here at least
      for a night and a day! He would not dare risk another hotel. He could, of
      course, go to the splendid Rathbone place; but it would not be fair to
      invite tragedy across that threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ball of crushed paper at his feet attracted his attention. He kicked it
      absently, followed and picked it up, his thought on other things. He was
      aimlessly smoothing it out when an English word caught his eye. English!
      He smoothed the crumpled sheet and read:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  If you find this it is the will of God.  I have been watched
  for several days, and am now convinced that they have always
  known I was here but were leaving me alone for some unknown
  purpose.  I roll this ball because anything folded and left
  in a conspicuous place would be useless should they come for
  me.  I understand.  It is you, poor boy.  They are watching
  me in hopes of catching you, and I've no way to warn you not
  to come here.  It was after I sent you the key that I learned
  the truth.  God bless you and guard you!
                                                       STEFANI.
</pre>
    <p>
      Hawksley tore the note into scraps. Food and sleep. He walked toward the
      kitchen, musing. What an odd mixture he was! Superficially British, with
      the British outlook; and yet filled with the dancing blood of the Latin
      and the cold, phlegmatic blood of the Slav. He was like a schoolmaster
      with two students too big for him to handle. Always the Latin was
      dispossessing the Slav or the Slav was ousting the Latin. With fatalistic
      confidence that nevermore would he look upon the kindly face of Stefani
      Gregor, alive, he went in search of food.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a crust did he find. In the ice-chest there was a bottle of milk&mdash;soured.
      Hungry; and not a crumb! And he dared not go out in search of food. No one
      had observed his entrance to the apartment, but it was improbable that
      such luck would attend him a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to the bedroom. He did not turn on the light because a novel
      idea had blossomed unexpectedly&mdash;a Latin idea. There might be food on
      some window ledge. He would leave payment. He proceeded to the window,
      throwing up both it and the curtain, and looked out. Ripping! There was a
      fire escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he slipped a leg over the sill a golden square sprang into existence
      across the way. Immediately he forgot his foraging instincts. In a moment
      he was all Latin, always susceptible to the enchantment of beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance across the court was less than forty feet. He could see the
      girl quite plainly as she set about the preparation of her evening meal.
      He forgot his danger, his hunger, his code of ethics, which did not permit
      him to gaze at a young woman through a window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone. He was alone and she was alone. A novel idea popped into his head.
      He chuckled; and the sound of that chuckle in his ears somehow brought
      back his resolve to carry on, to pass out, if so he must, fighting. He
      would knock on yonder window and ask the beautiful lady slavey for a bit
      of her supper!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kitty Conover had inherited brains and beauty, and nothing else but the
      furniture. Her father had been a famous reporter, the admiration of cubs
      from New York to San Francisco; handsome, happy-go-lucky, generous, rather
      improvident, and wholly lovable. Her mother had been a comedy actress
      noted for her beauty and wit and extravagance. Thus it will be seen that
      Kitty was in luck to inherit any furniture at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was twenty-four. A body is as old as it is, but a brain is as old as
      the facts it absorbs; and Kitty had absorbed enough facts to carry her
      brain well into the thirties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conover had been dead twenty years; and Kitty had scarcely any
      recollections of him. Improvident as the run of newspaper writers are,
      Conover had fulfilled one obligation to his family&mdash;he had kept up
      his endowment policies; and for eighteen years the insurance had taken
      care of Kitty and her mother, who because of a weak ankle had not been
      able to return to the scenes of her former triumphs. In 1915 this darling
      mother, whom Kitty loved to idolatry, had passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was enough for the funeral and the cleaning up of the bills; but
      that was all. The income ceased with Mrs. Conover's demise. Kitty saw that
      she must give up writing short stories which nobody wanted, and go to
      work. So she proceeded at once to the newspaper office where her father's
      name was still a tradition, and applied for a job. It was frankly a
      charity job, but Kitty was never to know that because she fell into the
      newspaper game naturally; and when they discovered her wide acquaintance
      among theatrical celebrities they switched her into the dramatic
      department, where she had astonishing success as a raconteur. She was now
      assistant dramatic editor of the Sunday issue, and her pay envelope had
      four crisp ten-dollar notes in it each Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      She still remained in the old apartment; sentiment as much as anything.
      She had been born in it and her happiest days had been spent there. She
      lived alone, without help, being one of that singular type of womanhood
      that is impervious to the rust of loneliness. Her daily activities
      sufficed the gregarious instincts, and it was often a relief to move about
      in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other things Kitty had foresight. She had learned that a little
      money in the background was the most satisfying thing in existence. So
      many times she and her mother had just reached the insurance check, with
      grumbling bill collectors in the hall, that she was determined never to be
      poor. She had to fight constantly her love of finery inherited from her
      mother, and her love of good times inherited from her father. So she
      established a bank account, and to date had not drawn a check against it;
      which speaks well for her will power, an attribute cultivated, not
      inherited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was as pleasing to the eye as a basket of fruit. Her beauty was
      animated. There was an expression in her eyes and on her lips that spoke
      of laughter always on tiptoe. An enviable inheritance, this, the desire to
      laugh, to be searching always for a vent to laughter; it is something
      money cannot buy, something not to be cultivated; a true gift of the gods.
      This desire to laugh is found invariably in the tender and valorous; and
      Kitty was both. Brown hair with running threads of gold that was always
      catching light; slate-blue eyes with heavy black fringe-Irish; colour that
      waxed and waned; and a healthy, shapely body. Topped by a sparkling
      intellect these gifts made Kitty desirable of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty had no beau. After the adolescent days beaux ceased to interest her.
      This would indicate that she was inclined toward suffrage. Nothing of the
      kind. Intensely romantic, she determined to await the grand passion or go
      it alone. No experimental adventures for her. Be assured that she weighed
      every new man she met, and finding some flaw discarded him as a
      matrimonial possibility. Besides, her unusual facilities to view and judge
      men had shown her masculine phases the average woman would have discovered
      only after the fatal knot was tied. She did not suspect that she was
      romantical. She attributed her wariness to common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is one place where a pretty young woman may labour without having
      to build a wall of liquid air about her to fend off amatory advances that
      place is the editorial room of a great metropolitan daily. One must have
      leisure to fall in love; and only the office boys could assemble enough
      idle time to call it leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her desk faced Burlingame's; and Burlingame was the dramatic editor, a
      scholar and a gentleman. He liked to hear Kitty talk, and often he lured
      her into the open; and he gathered information about theatrical folks that
      was outside even his wide range of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      A drizzly fog had hung over New York since morning. Kitty was finishing up
      some Sunday special. Burlingame was reading proofs. All day theatrical
      folks had been in and out of this little ten-by-twelve cubby-hole; and now
      there would be quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no. The door opened and an iron-gray head intruded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will I be in the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, no!&rdquo; cried Burlingame, throwing down his proofs. &ldquo;Come along in,
      Cutty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great war correspondent came in and sat down, sighing gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty was a nickname; he carried and smoked&mdash;everywhere they would
      permit him&mdash;the worst-looking and the worst-smelling pipe in
      Christendom. You may not realize it, but a nickname is a round-about
      Anglo-Saxon way of telling a fellow you love him. He was Cutty, but only
      among his dear intimates, mind you; to the world at large, to presidents,
      kings, ambassadors, generals, and capitalists he is known by another name.
      You will find it on the roster of the Royal Geographical; on the title
      page of several unique books on travel, jewels, and drums; in magazines
      and newspapers; on the membership roll of the Savage in London and the
      Lambs in New York. But you will not find it in this story; because it
      would not be fair to set his name against the unusual adventures that
      crossed his line of life with that of the young man who wore the tobacco
      pouch suspended from his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tall, bony, graceful enough except in a chair, where his angles became
      conspicuous; the ruddy, weather-bitten complexion of a deep-sea sailor,
      and a sailor man's blue eye; the brow of a thinker and the mouth of a
      humourist. Men often call another man handsome when a woman knows they
      mean manly. Among men Cutty was handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty considerately rose and gathered up her manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Kitty! I'd rather talk to you than Burly, here. You're always
      reminding me of that father of yours. Best comrade I ever had. You laugh
      just like him. Did your mother ever tell you that old Cutty is your
      godfather?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fact. I told your dad I'd watch over you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a fat lot of watching you've done to date,&rdquo; jeered Burlingame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't help that. But I can be on the job until I return to the
      Balkans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty laughed joyously and sat down, perhaps a little thrilled. She had
      always admired Cutty from afar, shyly. Once in a blue moon he had in the
      old days appeared for tea; and he and Mrs. Conover would spend the balance
      of the afternoon discussing the lovable qualities of Tommy Conover. Kitty
      had seen him but twice during the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every so often,&rdquo; began Cutty, &ldquo;I have to find listeners. Fact. I used to
      hate crowds, listeners; but those ten days in an open boat, a thousand
      miles from anywhere, made me gregarious. I'm always wanting company and
      hating to go to bed, which is bad business for a man of fifty-two.&rdquo;
       Cutty's ship had been torpedoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Kitty, with his tired eyes and weather-bitten face, his bony, gangling
      body, he had the appearance of a lazy man. Actually she knew him to be a
      man of tremendous vitality and endurance. Eagles when they roost are
      heavy-lidded and clumsy. She wondered if there was a corner on the globe
      he had not peered into.
    </p>
    <p>
      For thirty years he had been following two gods&mdash;Rumour and War. For
      thirty years he had been the slave of cables and telegrams. Even now he
      was preparing to return to the Balkans, where the great fire had started
      and where there were still some threatening embers to watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty was not well known in America; his reputation was European. He
      played the game because he loved it, being comfortably fortified with
      worldly goods. He was a linguist of rare attainments, specializing in the
      polyglot of southeastern Europe. He came and went like cloud shadow. His
      foresight was so keen he was seldom ordered to go here or there; he was
      generally on the spot when the orders arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was interested in socialism and its bewildering ramifications, but only
      as an analytical student. He could fit himself into any environment,
      interview a prime minister in the afternoon and take potluck that night
      with the anarchist who was planning to blow up the prime minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burlingame, an intimate, often exposed for Kitty's delectation the amazing
      and colourful facets of Cutty's diamond-brilliant mind. Cutty wrote
      authoritatively on famous gems and collected drums. He had one of the
      finest collections of chrysoprase in the world. He loved these
      semi-precious stones because of their unmatchable, translucent green&mdash;like
      the pulp of a grape. From Burlingame Kitty had learned that Cutty, rather
      indifferent to women, carried about with him the photographs&mdash;large
      size&mdash;of famous professional beauties and a case filled with polished
      chrysoprase. He would lay a photograph on a table and adorn the lovely
      throat with astonishing necklaces and the head with wonderful tiaras, all
      the while his brain at work with some intricate political puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he collected drums. The walls of his apartment&mdash;part of the loft
      of a midtown office building&mdash;were covered with a most startling
      assortment of drums: drums of war, of the dance, of the temples of the
      feast, ancient and modern, some of them dreadful looking objects, as Kitty
      had cause to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Cutty had known her father and mother intimately, Kitty was a
      comparative stranger. He recollected seeing her perhaps a dozen times. She
      had been a shy child, not given to climbing over visitors' knees; not the
      precocious offspring of the average theatrical mother. So in the past he
      had somewhat overlooked her. Then one day recently he had dropped in to
      see Burlingame and had seen Kitty instead; which accounts for his presence
      here this day. Neither Kitty nor Burlingame suspected the true attraction.
      The dramatic editor accepted the advent as a peculiar compliment to
      himself. And it is to be doubted if Cutty himself realized that there was
      a true magnetic pole in this cubbyhole of a room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty, however, had vivid recollections. Actually the first strange man
      she had ever met. But not having been visible on her horizon, except in
      flashes, she knew of the man only what she had read and what Burlingame
      had casually offered during discussions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyhow,&rdquo; said Burlingame, complacently, &ldquo;the war is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty smiled indulgently. &ldquo;That's the trouble with us chaps who tramp
      round the world for news. We can't bamboozle ourselves like you folks who
      stay at home. The war was only the first phase. There's a mess over there;
      wanting something and not knowing exactly what, those millions; milling
      cattle, with neither shed nor pasture. The Lord only knows how long it
      will take to clarify. Would you mind if I smoked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; cried Burlingame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; answered Kitty. &ldquo;I don't see how any pipe could be worse
      than Mr. Burlingame's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I apologize,&rdquo; said the dramatic editor, humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't,&rdquo; replied the girl. She turned to the war correspondent. &ldquo;Any
      new drums?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember that day. You were scared half to death at my walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small wonder! I was only twelve; and I dreamed of cannibals for weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drums! I wonder if any living man has heard a greater variety than I?
      What a lot of them! I have heard them calling a jehad in the Sudan.
      Tumpi-tum-tump! tumpitum-tump! Makes a white man's hair stand up when he
      hears it in the night. I don't know what it is, but the sound drives the
      Oriental mad. And that reminds me&mdash;I've had them in mind all day&mdash;the
      drums of jeopardy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an odd phrase! And what are the drums of jeopardy?&rdquo; asked Kitty,
      leaning on her arms. Odd, but suddenly she felt a longing to go somewhere,
      thousands and thousands of miles away. She had never been west of Chicago
      or east of Boston. Until this moment she had never felt the call of the
      blood&mdash;her father's. Cocoanut palms and birds of paradise! And drums
      in the night going tumpi-tum-tump! tumpi-tum-tump!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've always been mad over green things,&rdquo; began Cutty. &ldquo;A wheat field in
      the spring, leafing maples. It's Nature's choice and mine. My passion is
      emeralds; and I haven't any because those I want are beyond reach. They
      are owned by the great houses of Europe and Asia, and lie in royal
      caskets; or did. If I could go into a mine and find an emerald as big as
      my fist I should be only partly happy if it chanced to be of fine colour.
      In a little while I should lose interest in it. It wouldn't be alive, if
      you can get what I mean. Just as a man would rather have a homely woman to
      talk to than a beautiful window dummy to admire. A stone to interest me
      must have a story&mdash;a story of murder and loot, of beautiful women,
      palaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Br-r-r!&rdquo; cried Burlingame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I've seen emeralds I would steal with half a chance. I couldn't help
      it. Fact,&rdquo; declared Cutty, earnestly. &ldquo;Think of the loot in the Romanoff
      palaces! What's become of all those magnificent stones? In a little while
      they'll be turning up in Amsterdam to be cut&mdash;some of them. Or maybe
      Mister Bolsheviki's inamorata will be stringing them round her neck.
      Loot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the drums of jeopardy!&rdquo; said Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emeralds, green as an English lawn in May after a shower, Kitty. By the
      way, do you mind if I call you Kitty? I used to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I've always thought of you as Cutty. Fifty-fifty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a bargain. Well, the drums to my thinking are the finest two
      examples of the green beryl in the world. Polished, of course, as emeralds
      always should be. I should say that they were about the size of those
      peppermint chocolate drops there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have one?&rdquo; said Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Spoil the taste of the pipe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to spoil that taste once in a while,&rdquo; was Burlingame's
      observation. &ldquo;But go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose originally there was a single stone, later cut into halves,
      because they are perfect matches. The drums proper are exquisitely carved
      ivory statuettes, of Hindu or Mohammedan drummers, squatting, the golden
      base of the drums between the knees, and the drumheads the emeralds. Lord,
      how they got to me! I wanted to run off with them. The history of murder
      and loot they could tell! Some Delhi mogul owned them first. Then Nadir
      Shah carried them off to Persia, along with the famous peacock throne. I
      saw them in a palace on the Caspian in 1912. Russia was very strong in
      Persia at one time. Perhaps they were gifts; perhaps they were stolen&mdash;these
      emeralds. Anyhow, I'd never heard of them until that year. And I travelled
      all the way up from Constantinople to get a glimpse of them if it were
      possible. I had to do some mighty fine wire-pulling. For one of those
      stones I would give half of all I own. To see them in the possession of
      another man would be a supreme test to my honesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You old pirate!&rdquo; said Burlingame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why the word jeopardy?&rdquo; persisted Kitty, who was intrigued by the
      phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably some Hindu trick. It is a language of flowery metaphors. It
      means, I suppose, that when you touch the drums they bite. In journeying
      from one spot to another they always leave misfortune behind, as I
      understand it. Just coincidence; but you couldn't drive that into an
      Oriental skull. This is what makes the study of precious stones so
      interesting. There is always some enchantment, some evil spell. To handle
      the drums is to invite a minor accident. Call it twaddle; probably is; and
      yet I have reason to believe that there's something to the superstition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burlingame sniffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can prove it,&rdquo; Cutty declared. &ldquo;I held those drums in my hands one day.
      I carried them to a window the better to observe them. On my return to the
      hotel I was knocked down by a horse and laid up in bed for a week. That
      same night someone tried to kill the man who showed me the emeralds.
      Coincidence? Perhaps. But these days I'm shying at thirteen, the wrong
      side of the street, ladders, and religious curses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An old hard-boiled egg like you?&rdquo; Burlingame threw up his hands in mock
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I laugh, too; but I duck, nevertheless. The chap who showed me the stones
      was what you'd call the honorary custodian; a privileged character because
      of his genius. Before approaching him I sent him a copy of my monograph on
      green stones. I found that he was quite as crazy over green as I. That
      brought us together; and while I drew him out I kept wondering where I had
      seen him before. Both his name and his face were vaguely familiar. It
      seems a superstition had come along with the stones, from India to Persia,
      from there to Russia. A maid fortunate enough to see the drums would marry
      and be happy. The old fellow confessed that occasionally he secretly
      admitted a peasant maid to gaze upon the stones. But he never let the male
      inmates of the palace find this out. He knew them a little too intimately.
      A bad lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this palace?&rdquo; asked Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one stone on another. The proletariat rose up and destroyed it. To
      mobs anything beautiful is offensive. Palaces looted, banks, museums,
      houses. The ignorant toying with hand grenades, thinking them sceptres.
      All the scum in the world boiling to the top. After the Red Day comes the
      Red Night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever will become of them&mdash;the little kings and princes and
      dukes?&rdquo; After all, thought Kitty, they were human beings; they would not
      suffer any the less because they had been born to the purple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe they'll go to work,&rdquo; said Cutty, dryly. &ldquo;Sooner or later, all
      parasites will have to work if they want bread. And yet I've met some men
      among them, big in the heart and the mind, who would have made bully
      farmers and professors. The beautiful thing about the Anglo-Saxon
      education is that the whole structure is based upon fair play. In eastern
      and southeastern Europe few of them can play solitaire without cheating.
      But I would give a good deal to know what has happened to those emeralds&mdash;the
      drums of jeopardy. They'll probably be broken up and sold in carat
      weights. The whole family was wiped out in a night.... I say, will you
      take lunch with me to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gladly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I'll drop in here at half after twelve. Here's my telephone
      number, should anything alter your plans. If I'm going to be godfather I
      might as well start right in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The drums of jeopardy; what a haunting phrase!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haunting stones, too, Kitty. For picking them up in my hands I went to
      bed with a banged-up leg. I can't forget that. We Occidentals laugh at
      Orientals and their superstitions. We don't believe in the curse. And yet,
      by George, those emeralds were accursed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Piffle!&rdquo; snorted Burlingame. &ldquo;Mush! It's greed, pure and simple, that
      gives precious stones their sinister histories. You'd have been hit by
      that horse if you had picked up nothing more valuable than a rhinestone
      buckle. Take away the gold lure, and precious stones wouldn't sell at the
      price of window glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so? How about me? It isn't because a stone is worth so much that
      makes me want it. I want it for the sheer beauty; I want it for the
      tremendous panorama the sight of it unfolds in my mind. I imagine what
      happened from the hour the stone was mined to the hour it came into my
      possession. To me&mdash;to all genuine collectors&mdash;the intrinsic
      value is nil. Can't you see? It is for me what Balzac's La Peau de Chagrin
      would be to you if you had fallen on it for the first time&mdash;money,
      love, tragedy, death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An interruption came in the form of one of the office boys. The chief was
      on the wire and wanted Cutty at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At half after twelve, Kitty. And by the way,&rdquo; added Cutty as he rose,
      &ldquo;they say about the drums that a beautiful woman is immune to their
      danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's your chance, Kitty,&rdquo; said Burlingame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I beautiful?&rdquo; asked Kitty, demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord love the minx!&rdquo; shouted Cutty. &ldquo;A corner in Mouquin's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rain or shine.&rdquo; After Cutty had departed Kitty said: &ldquo;He's the most
      fascinating man I know. What fun it would be to jog round the world with a
      man like that, who knew everybody and everything. As a little girl I was
      violently in love with him; but don't you ever dare give me away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll probably have nightmare to-night. And honestly you ought not to
      live in that den alone. But Cutty has seen things,&rdquo; Burlingame admitted;
      &ldquo;things no white man ought to see. He's been shot up, mauled by animals,
      marooned, torpedoed at sea, made prisoner by old Fuzzy-Wuzzy. An ordinary
      man would have died of fatigue. Cutty is as tough and strong as a gorilla
      and as active as a cat. But this jewel superstition is all rot. Odd,
      though; he'll travel halfway round the world to see a ruby or an emerald.
      He says no true collector cares a cent for a diamond. Says they are
      vulgar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except on the third finger of a lady's left hand; and then they are just
      perfectly splendid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho! Well, when you get yours I hope it's as big as the Koh-i-noor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you! You might just as well wish a brick on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty left the office at a quarter of six. The phrase kept running through
      her head&mdash;the drums of jeopardy. A little shiver ran up her spine.
      Money, love, tragedy, death! This terrible and wonderful old world, of
      which she had seen little else than city streets, suddenly exhibited wide
      vistas. She knew now why she had begun to save&mdash;travel. Just as soon
      as she had a thousand she would go somewhere. A great longing to hear
      native drums in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as the wish entered her mind a new sound entered her ears. The Subway
      car wheels began to beat&mdash;tumpitum-tump! tumpitum-tump! Fudge! She
      opened her evening paper and scanned the fashions, the dramatic news, and
      the comics. Being a woman she read the world news last. On the front page
      she saw a queer story, dated at Albany: Mysterious guests at a hotel; how
      they had fought and fled in the early morning. There had been left behind
      a case with foreign orders incrusted with several thousand dollars' worth
      of gems. Bolsheviki, said the police; just as they said auto bandits a few
      years ago when confronted with something they could not understand. The
      orders had been turned over to the Federal authorities from whom it was
      learned that they were all royal and demi-royal. Neither of the two guests
      had returned up to noon, and one had fled, leaving even his hat and coat.
      But there was nothing to indicate his identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loot!&rdquo; murmured Kitty. &ldquo;All the scum in the world rising to the top&rdquo;&mdash;quoting
      Cutty. &ldquo;Poor things!&rdquo; as she thought of the gentle ladies who had died
      horribly in bedrooms and cellars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was beginning to cast about for more congenial quarters. There were
      too many foreigners in the apartments, and none of them especially good
      housekeepers. Always, nowadays, somebody had a washing out on the line,
      the odour of garlic was continuously in the air, and there were noisy
      children under foot in the halls. The families she and her mother had
      known were all gone; and Kitty was perhaps the oldest inhabitant in the
      block.
    </p>
    <p>
      The living-room windows faced Eightieth Street; bedrooms, dining room, and
      kitchen looked out upon the court. From the latter windows one could step
      out upon the fire-escape platform, which ran round the three sides of the
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the present tenants she knew but one, an old man by the name of
      Gregory, who lived opposite. The acquaintance had never ripened into
      friendship; but sometimes Kitty would borrow an egg and he would borrow
      some sugar. In the summertime, when the windows were open at night, she
      had frequently heard the music of a violin swimming across the court.
      Polish, Russian, and Hungarian music, always speaking with a tragic note;
      nothing she had ever heard in concerts. Once, however, she had heard him
      begin something from Thais, and stop in the middle of it; and that
      convinced her that he was a master. She was fond of good music. One day
      she asked Gregory why he did not teach music instead of valeting at a
      hotel. His answer had been illuminative. It was only his body that pressed
      clothes; but it would have torn his soul to listen daily to the agonized
      bow of the novice. Kitty was lonely through pride as much as anything. As
      for friends, she had a regiment of them. But she rarely accepted their
      hospitality, realizing that she could not return it. No young men called
      because she never invited them. All this, however, was going to change
      when she moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she turned on the hail light she saw an envelope on the floor.
      Evidently it had been shoved under the door. It was unstamped. She opened
      it, and stepped out of the humdrum into the whirligig.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  DEAR MISS CONOVER:
  If anything should happen to me all the things in my apartment
  I give to you without reservation.
                                               STEPHEN GREGORY.
</pre>
    <p>
      She read the letter a dozen times to make sure that it meant exactly what
      it said. He might be ill. After she had cooked her supper she would run
      round and inquire. The poor lonely old man!
    </p>
    <p>
      She went into the kitchen and took inventory. There was nothing but bacon
      and eggs and coffee. She had forgotten to order that morning. She lit the
      gas range and began to prepare the meal. As she broke an egg against the
      rim of the pan the nearby Elevated train rushed by, drumming
      tumpitum-tump! tumpitum-tump! She laughed, but it wasn't honest laughter.
      She laughed because she was conscious that she was afraid of something.
      Impulse drove her to the window. Contact with men&mdash;her unusual
      experiences as a reporter&mdash;had developed her natural fearlessness to
      a point where it was aggressive. As she pressed the tip of her nose
      against the pane, however, she found herself gazing squarely into a pair
      of exceedingly brilliant dark eyes; and all the blood in her body seemed
      to rush violently into her throat.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kitty gasped, but she did not cry out. The five days' growth of blondish
      stubble, the discoloured eye&mdash;for all the orb itself was brilliant&mdash;and
      the hawky nose combined to send through her the first great thrill of
      danger she had ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly she backed away from the window. The man outside immediately
      extended his hands with a gesture that a child would have understood.
      Supplication. Kitty paused, naturally. But did the man mean it? Might it
      not be some trick to lure her into opening the window? And what was he
      doing outside there anyhow? Her mind, freed from the initial hypnosis of
      the encounter, began to work quickly. If she ran from the kitchen to call
      for help he might be gone when she returned, only to come back when she
      was again alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the man executed that gesture, his palms upward. It was Latin;
      she was aware of that, for she was always encountering it in the halls.
      Another gesture. She understood this also. The tips of the fingers bunched
      and dabbed at the lips. She had seen Italian children make the gesture and
      cry: &ldquo;Ho fame!&rdquo; Hungry. But she could not let him into the kitchen. Still,
      if he were honestly hungry&mdash;She had it!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the kitchen-table drawer was an imitation revolver&mdash;press the
      trigger, and a fluted fan was revealed&mdash;a dance favour she had
      received during the winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She plucked it out of the drawer and walked bravely to the window, which
      she threw up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want? What are you doing out there on the fire escape?&rdquo; she
      instantly demanded to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, I am hungry! I was looking out of the window across the way and
      saw you preparing your dinner. A bit of bread and a glass of milk. Would
      you mind, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you come to the door then? What window?&rdquo; Kitty was resolute;
      once she embarked upon an enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mr. Gregory?&rdquo; Kitty recalled that odd letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gregory? I should very much like to know. I have come many miles to see
      him. He sent me a duplicate key. There was not even a crust in the
      cupboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregory away? That letter! Something had happened to that poor, kindly old
      man. &ldquo;Why did you not seek some restaurant? Or have you no money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have plenty. I was afraid that I might not be able conveniently to
      return. I am a stranger. My actions might be viewed with suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Describe Mr. Gregory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not of the clinging kind, evidently, he thought. A raving beauty&mdash;Diana
      domesticated!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is four years since I saw him. He was then gray, dapper, and erect. A
      mole on his chin, which he rubs when he talks. He is a valet in one of the
      fashionable hotels. He is&mdash;or was&mdash;the only true friend I have
      in New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid something has happened to him. I found his bedroom things
      tossed about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could possibly happen to a harmless old man like Mr. Gregory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, but your egg is burning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty wheeled and lifted off the pan, choking in the smother of smoke. She
      came right-about face swiftly enough. The man had not moved; and that
      decided her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in. I will give you something to eat. Sit in that chair by the
      window, and be careful not to stir from it. I'm a good shot,&rdquo; lied Kitty,
      truculently. &ldquo;Frankly, I do not like the looks of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do look like a burglar, what?&rdquo; He sat down in the chair meekly. Food
      and a human being to talk to! A lovely, self-reliant American girl, able
      to take care of herself. Magnificent eyes&mdash;slate blue, with thick,
      velvety black lashes. Irish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment Kitty had three eggs and half a dozen strips of bacon frying
      in a fresh pan. She kept one eye upon the pan and the other upon the
      intruder, risking strabismus. At length she transferred the contents of
      the pan to a plate, backed to the ice chest, and reached for a bottle of
      milk. She placed the food at the far end of the table and retreated a few
      steps, her arms crossed in such a way as to keep the revolver in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do not be afraid of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any woman would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty saw that he was actually hungry, and her suspicions began to ebb. He
      hadn't lied about that. And he ate like a gentleman. Young, not more than
      thirty; possibly less. But that dreadful stubble and that black eye! The
      clothes would have passed muster on any fashionable golf links. A
      fugitive? From what?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, setting down the empty milk bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your accent is English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That your gestures are Italian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother was Italian. But what makes you believe I am not English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Englishman&mdash;or an American, for that matter&mdash;with money in
      his pocket would have gone into the street in search of a restaurant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. The fundamentals of the blood will always crop out. You
      can educate the brain but not the blood. I am not an Englishman; I merely
      received my education at Oxford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fugitive, however, of any blood might have come to my window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I am a fugitive, pursued by the god of Irony. And Irony is never
      particular; the chase is the thing. What matters it whether the quarry be
      wolf or sheep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was impressed by the bitterness of the tone. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Hawksley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is English!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not care to call myself Two-Hawks, literally. It would be
      embarrassing. So I call myself Hawksley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pause. Kitty wondered what new impetus she might give to the
      conversation, which was interesting her despite her distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come by that black eye?&rdquo; she asked with embarrassing
      directness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley smiled, revealing beautifully white teeth. &ldquo;I say, it is a bit
      off, isn't it! I received it&rdquo;&mdash;a twinkle coming into his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;in
      a situation that had moribund perspectives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moribund perspectives,&rdquo; repeated Kitty, casting the phrase about in her
      mind in search of an equivalent less academic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am young and healthy, and I wanted to live,&rdquo; he said, gravely. &ldquo;I am
      curious to know what is going to happen to-morrow and other to-morrows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere near by a door was slammed violently. Kitty, every muscle in her
      body tense, jumped convulsively, with the result that her finger pressed
      automatically the trigger of her pistol. The fan popped out gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley stared at the fan, quite as astonished as Kitty. Then he broke
      into low, rollicking laughter, which Kitty, because her basic corpuscle
      was Irish, perforce had to join. For all her laughter she retreated,
      furious and alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy! I say, now, you're jolly plucky to face a scoundrel like me with
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't just know what to make of you,&rdquo; said Kitty, irresolutely,
      flinging the fan into a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have revivified a celestial spark&mdash;my faith in human beings. I
      beg of you not to be afraid of me. I am quite harmless. I am very grateful
      for the meal. Yours is the one act of kindness I have known in weeks. I
      will return to Gregor's apartment at once. But before I go please accept
      this. I rather suspect, you know, that you live alone, and that fan is
      amusing and not particularly suitable.&rdquo; He rose and unsmilingly laid upon
      the table one of those heavy blue-black bull-dogs of war, a regulation
      revolver. Kitty understood what this courteous act signified; he was
      disarming himself to reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she ordered. Either he was harmless or he wasn't. If he wasn't
      she was utterly at his mercy. She might be able to lift that
      terrible-looking engine of murder, battle, and sudden death with the aid
      of both hands, but to aim and fire it&mdash;never in this world! &ldquo;As I
      came in to-night I found a note in the hall from Mr. Gregory. I will fetch
      it. But you call him Gregor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is Stefani Gregor; and years and years ago he dandled me on his
      knees. I promise not to move until you return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Subdued by she knew not what, no longer afraid, Kitty moved out of the
      kitchen. She had offered Gregory's letter as an excuse to reach the
      telephone. Once there, however, she did not take the receiver off the
      hook. Instead she whistled down the tube for the janitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Miss Conover. Come up to my apartment in ten minutes.... No; it's
      not the water pipes.... In ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing very serious could happen inside of ten minutes; and the janitor
      was reliable and not the sort one reads about in the comic weeklies. Her
      confidence reenforced by the knowledge that a friend was near, she took
      the letter into the kitchen. Apparently her unwelcome guest had not
      stirred. The revolver was where he had laid it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read this,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor glanced through it. &ldquo;It is Gregor's hand. Poor old chap! I
      shall never forgive my self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For dragging him into this. They must have intercepted one of my
      telegrams.&rdquo; He stared dejectedly at the strip of oilcloth in front of the
      range. &ldquo;You are an American?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God has been exceedingly kind to your country. I doubt if you will ever
      know how kind. I'll take myself off. No sense in compromising you.&rdquo; He
      laid a folded handkerchief inside his cap which he put on. &ldquo;Know anything
      about this?&rdquo;&mdash;indicating the revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to show you. It is loaded; there are five bullets in the clip.
      See this little latch? So, it is harmless. So, and you kill with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is horrible!&rdquo; cried Kitty. &ldquo;Take it with you please. I could not keep
      my eyes open to shoot it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are troublous times. All women should know something about small
      arms. Again I thank you. For your own sake I trust that we may never meet
      again. Good-bye.&rdquo; He stepped out of the window and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty, at a mental impasse, could only stare into the night beyond the
      window. This mesmeric state endured for a minute; then a gentle and
      continuous sound dissipated the spell. It was raining. Obliquely she saw
      the burnt egg in the pan. The thing had happened; she had not been
      dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brain awoke. Thought crowded thought; before one matured another
      displaced it; and all as futile as the sparks from the anvil. An avalanche
      of conjecture; and out of it all eventually emerged one concrete fact. The
      man Was honest. His hunger had been honest; his laughter. Who was he, what
      was he? For all his speech, not English; for all his gestures, not
      Italian. Moribund perspectives. Somewhere that day he had fought for his
      life. John Two-Hawks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was the mysterious evanishment of old Gregory, whose name was
      Stefani Gregor. In a humdrum, prosaic old apartment like this!
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty had ideas about adventure&mdash;an inheritance, though she was not
      aware of that. There had to be certain ingredients, principally mystery.
      Anything sordid must not be permitted to edge in. She had often gone forth
      upon semi-perilous enterprises as a reporter, entered sinister houses
      where crimes had been committed, but always calculating how much copy at
      eight dollars a column could be squeezed out of the affair. But this
      promised to be something like those tales which were always clear and
      wonderful in her head but more or less opaque when she attempted to
      transfer them to paper. A secret society? Vengeance? An echo of the war?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnny Two-Hawks,&rdquo; she murmured aloud. &ldquo;And he hopes we'll never meet
      again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a mirror over the sink, and she threw a glance into it. Very
      well; if he thought like that about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the doorbell tinkled. That would be the faithful janitor. She ran to
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whadjuh wanta see me about, Miz Conover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened to old Mr. Gregory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him? Why, some amb'lance fellers carted him off this afternoon. Didn't
      know nawthin' was the matter with 'im until I runs into them in the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd been hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't say, miz. He was on a stretcher when I seen 'im. Under a sheet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he might have been dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope. I ast 'em, an' they said a shock of some sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hospital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee, I forgot t'ast that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll find out. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Kitty did not find out. She called up all the known private and public
      hospitals, but no Gregor or Gregory had been received that afternoon, nor
      anybody answering his description. The fog had swallowed up Stefani
      Gregor.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The reportorial instinct in Kitty Conover, combined with her natural
      feminine curiosity, impelled her to seek to the bottom of affair. Her
      newspaper was as far from her as the poles; simply a paramount desire to
      translate the incomprehensible into sequence and consequence. Harmless old
      Gregor's disappearance and the advent of John Two-Hawks&mdash;the
      absurdity of that name!&mdash;with his impeccable English accent, his
      Latin gestures, and his black eye, convinced her that it was political; an
      electrical cross current out of that broken world over there. Moribund
      perspectives. What did that signify save that Johnny Two-Hawks had fought
      somewhere that day for his life? Had Gregor been spirited away so as to
      leave Two-Hawks without support, to confuse and discourage him and break
      down his powers of resistance? Or had there been something of great value
      in the Gregor apartment, and Johnny Two-Hawks had come too late to save
      his friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      A word slipped into her mind like a whiff of miasma off an evil swamp. As
      she recognized the word she felt the same horror and repugnance one senses
      upon being unexpectedly confronted by a cobra. Internationalism. The scum
      of the world boiling to the top. A half-blind viper striking venomously at
      everything&mdash;even itself! A destroyer who tore down but who knew not
      how or what to build. Kitty knew that lower New York was seething with
      this species of terrorism&mdash;thousands of noisome European rats trying
      to burrow into the granary of democracy. But she had no particular fear of
      the result. The reacting chemicals of American humour and common sense
      would neutralize that virus. Supposing a ripple from this indecent eddy
      had touched her feet? The torch of liberty in the hands of Anarch!
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Two-Hawks. Somehow&mdash;even if she never saw him again&mdash;she
      knew she would always remember him by that name. Phases of the encounter
      began to return. Fine hands; perhaps he painted or played. The oblong head
      of well-balanced mentality. A pleasant voice. Breeding. To be sure, he had
      laughed at that fan popping out. Anybody would have laughed. Never had she
      felt so idiotic. He had gravely expressed the hope that they might never
      meet again because his life was in danger. What danger? Conceivably the
      enmity of a society&mdash;internationalism. The word having found lodgment
      in her thoughts took root. Internationalism&mdash;Utopia while you wait!
      Anarchism and Bolshevism offering nostrums for humanity's ills! And there
      were sane men who defended the cult on the basis that the intention was
      honest. Who can say that the rattlesnake does not consider his intentions
      honourable?
    </p>
    <p>
      The attribute lacking in the ape to make him human is continuity of
      thought and action in all things save one. He often starts out well but he
      never arrives. His interest is never sustained. He drops one thing and
      turns to another. The exception is his enmity, savage and cunning,
      relentless and enduring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was awake to one fact. She could not venture to dig into this affair
      alone. On the other hand, she did not want one of the men from the city
      room&mdash;a reporter who would see nothing but news. If Gregor was only a
      prisoner publicity might be the cause of his death; and publicity would
      certainly react hardily against Johnny Two-Hawks. To whom might she turn?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty!&mdash;with his great physical strength, his shrewd and alert
      mentality, and his wide knowledge of peoples and tongues. There was the
      man for her&mdash;Kitty Conover's godfather. She dumped the contents of
      her handbag upon the stand in the hallway in her impatience to find
      Cutty's card with his telephone number. It was not in the directory. She
      might catch him before he went out for the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Japanese voice answered her call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Souse, but he iss out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has he been gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Scuse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty heard the click of the receiver as it went down upon the hook. But
      she wasn't the daughter of Conover for nothing. She called up the
      University Club. No. The Harvard Club. No. The Players, the Lambs; and in
      the latter club she found him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Cutty spoke impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty Conover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! What's the matter? Can't you have lunch with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something very strange is happening in this old apartment house, Cutty.
      I'm afraid it is a matter of life and death. Otherwise I shouldn't have
      bothered you. Can you come up right away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as a taxi can take me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty then went through the apartment and turned out all the lights. Next
      she drew up a chair to the kitchen window and sat down to watch. All was
      dark across the way. But there was nothing singular in this fact. Johnny
      Two-Hawks would have sense enough to realize that it would be safer to
      move about in the dark. It was even probable that he was lying down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tumpitum-tump! Tumpitum-tump! went the racing Elevated; and Kitty's heart
      raced along with it. Queer how the echo of Cutty's description of the
      drums calling a jehad&mdash;a holy war&mdash;should adapt itself to that
      Elevated. Drums! Perhaps the echo clung because she had been interested
      beyond measure in his tale of those two emeralds, the drums of jeopardy.
      Mobs sacking palaces and museums and banks and homes; all the scum of the
      world boiling to the top; the Red Night that wasn't over.
    </p>
    <p>
      She uttered a shaky little laugh. She would tell Cutty. The real drums of
      jeopardy weren't emeralds but the roll of warning that prescience taps
      upon the spine, the occult sense of impending danger. That was why the
      Elevated went tumpitum-tump! tumpitum-tump! She would tell Cutty. The
      drums of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He over there and she here, in darkness; both of them waiting for
      something to happen; and the invisible drumsticks beating the tattoo of
      fear. If he were in her thoughts might not she be a little in his? She
      stood up. She would do it. Convention in a moment like this was nonsense.
      Hadn't he kept his side of the line scrupulously?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nonchalance. It occurred to her for the first time that there must be good
      material in a man who could come through in a contest with death,
      nonchalant. She would fetch him and have him here to meet Cutty, this
      rather forlorn Johnny Two-Hawks, with his unshaven face, his black eye,
      and his nonchalance. She would fetch him at once. It would save a good
      deal of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were but ten apartments in the building, two on a floor. The living
      room formed an L. Kitty's buttressed Gregor's. The elevator shaft was
      inside, facing the court; and the stair head was on the Gregor side of the
      elevator. The two entrances faced each other across the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Kitty opened her door to step outside she was nonplussed to see two men
      issue cautiously from the Gregor door. The moment they espied her,
      however, there was a mad rush for the stair head. She could hear the thud
      of their feet all the way down to the ground floor; and every footfall
      seemed to touch her heart. One of them carried a bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      She breathed quickly, and she knew that she was afraid. Neither man was
      Johnny Two-Hawks. Something dreadful had happened; she was sure of it.
      Reenforcing her sinking courage with nerve energy she ran across to the
      Gregor door and knocked. No answer. She knocked again; then she tried the
      door. Locked. The flutter in her breast died away; she became quite calm.
      She was going to enter this apartment by the way of the fire escape. The
      window he had come out of was still up. She had made note of this from the
      kitchen. In returning he had stepped on to the springe of a snare.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried back to her kitchen for the automatic. She hadn't the least
      idea how to manipulate it; but she was no longer afraid of it. Bravely she
      stepped out on to the fire escape. To reach her objective she had to walk
      under the ladder. Danger often puts odd irrelevancies into the human
      brain. As she moved forward she wondered if there was anything in the
      superstition regarding ladders.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she reached the window she leaned against the brick wall and
      listened. Silence; an ominous silence. The window was open, the curtain
      up. Within, what? For as long as five minutes she waited, then she climbed
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now as this bedroom was a counterpart of her own she knew where the light
      button would be. She might stumble over a chair or two, but in the end she
      would find the light. The fingers of one hand spread out before her and
      the other clutching the impossible automatic, she succeeded in navigating
      the uncharted reefs of an unfamiliar room. She blinked for a moment after
      throwing on the light, and stood with her back to the wall, the automatic
      wabbling at nothing in particular. The room was empty so far as she could
      see. There was evidence of a physical encounter, but she could not tell
      whether it was due to the former or to the latter invasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was he? From where she stood she could not see the floor on the far
      side of the bed. Timidly she walked past the foot of the bed&mdash;and the
      transient paralysis of horror laid hold of her. She became bereft of the
      power to grasp and hold, and the automatic slipped from her fingers and
      thudded on the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the floor lay poor Johnny Two-Hawks, crumpled grotesquely, a streak of
      blood zigzagging across his forehead; to all appearances, dead!
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Twice before in her life Kitty had looked upon death by violence; and it
      required only this present picture to convince her that she would never be
      able to gaze upon it callously, without pity and terror. Newspaper life&mdash;at
      least the reportorial side of it&mdash;has an odd effect upon men and
      women; it sharpens their tragical instincts and perceptions and dulls
      eternally the edge of tenderness and sentimentality. It was natural for
      Kitty to possess the keenest perceptions of tragedy; but she had been
      taken out of the reportorial field in time to preserve all her tenderness
      and romanticism. Otherwise she would have seen in that crumpled object
      with the sinister daub of blood on the forehead merely a story, and would
      have approached it from that angle. But was he dead? She literally forced
      her steps toward the body and stared. She dropped to her knees because
      they were threatening to buckle in one of those flashes of physical
      incoordination to which the strongest will must bow occasionally. She was
      no longer afraid of the tragedy, but she feared the great surging pity
      that was striving to express itself in sobs; and she knew that if she
      surrendered she would forthwith become hysterical for the rest of the
      evening and incompetent to carry out the plan in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strong, healthy young man done to death in this fashion only a few
      minutes after he had left her kitchen! Somehow she could not look upon him
      as a stranger. She had given him food; she had talked to him; she had even
      laughed with him. He was not like those dead she had seen in her
      reportorial days. Her orbit and Johnny Two-Hawks' had indeterminately
      touched; she had known old Gregory, or Gregor, who had been this
      unfortunate young man's friend. And he had hoped they might never meet
      again!
    </p>
    <p>
      The murderous scoundrels had been watching. They must have entered the
      apartment shortly after he had entered hers. Conceivably they would have
      Gregor's key. And they had watched and waited, striking him down it may
      have been at the very moment he had crossed the sill of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand shook so idiotically that it was impossible for a time to tell if
      the man's heart was beating. All at once a wave of hot fury rushed over
      her&mdash;fury at the cowardliness of the assault&mdash;and the vertigo
      passed. She laid her palm firmly over Johnny Two-Hawks' heart. Alive! He
      was alive! She straightened his body and put a pillow under his head. Then
      she sought water and towels.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no cut on his forehead, only blood; but the top of his head had
      been cruelly beaten. He was alive, but without immediate aid he might die.
      The poor young man!
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two physicians in the block; one or the other would be in. She
      ran to the door, to find it locked. She had forgotten. Next she found the
      telephone wire cut and the speaking tube battered and inutile. She would
      have to return to her own apartment to summon help. She dared not leave
      the light on. The scoundrels might possibly return, and the light would
      warn them that their victim had been discovered; and naturally they would
      wish to ascertain whether or not they had succeeded in their murderous
      assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she was passing the first-landing windows she saw Cutty emerging from
      the elevator. She flew across the fire-escape platform with the resilient
      step of one crossing thin ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably the most astonished man in New York was the war correspondent
      when the door opened and a pair of arms were flung about him, and a voice
      smothered in the lapel of his coat cried: &ldquo;Oh, Cutty, I never was so glad
      to see any one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the name of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! We'll handle this ourselves. Hurry!&rdquo; She dragged him along by the
      sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is life and death! No talk now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty, immaculate in his evening clothes, very much perturbed, went along
      after her. As she passed through the kitchen window and beckoned him to
      follow he demurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, what the deuce is going on here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll answer your questions when we get him into my apartment. They tried
      to murder him; left him there to die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty possessed a great art, an art highly developed only in explorers and
      newspaper reporters of the first order&mdash;adaptability; of being able
      to cast aside instantly the conventions of civilization and let down the
      bars to the primordial, the instinctive, and the natural. Thus the Cutty
      who stepped out beside Kitty into the drizzle was not the Cutty she had
      admitted into the apartment. She did not recognize this remarkable
      transition until later; and then she discovered that Cutty, the suave and
      lackadaisical in idleness, was a tremendous animal hibernating behind a
      crackle shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily Cutty would have declined to come through this shell, thin as
      it was; he liked these catnaps between great activities. But this lovely
      creature was Conover's daughter, and she would have the seventh
      sense-divination of the born reporter. Something big was in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he said, briskly. &ldquo;I'm at your heels. And stoop as you pass those
      hall windows. No use throwing a silhouette for somebody in those rear
      houses to see.... Old Tommy Conover's daughter, sure pop!... There you go,
      under the ladder! You've dished the whole affair, whatever it is.... No,
      no! Just spoofing, Kitty. A long face is no good anywhere, even at a
      funeral.... This window? All right. Know where the lights are? Very good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Cutty saw the man on the floor he knelt quickly. &ldquo;Nasty bang on the
      head, but he's alive. What's this? His cap. Poughkeepsie. By George,
      padded with his handkerchief! Must have known something was going to fall
      on him. Now, what's it all about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we get him to my apartment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours? Good Lord, what's the matter with this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tried to kill him here. They might return to see if they had
      succeeded. They mustn't find where he has gone. I'm strong. I can take
      hold of his knees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! Neither of us could walk backward over that fire escape. He looks
      husky, but I'll try it. Now obey me without question or comment. You'll
      have to help me get him outside the window and in through yours. Between
      the two windows I can handle him alone. I only hope we shan't be noticed,
      for that might prove awkward. Now take hold. That's it. When I'm through
      the window just push his legs outside.&rdquo; Panting, Kitty obeyed. &ldquo;All
      right,&rdquo; said Cutty. &ldquo;I like your pluck. You run along ahead and be ready
      to help me in with him. A healthy beggar! Here goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a heave and a hunch and another heave Cutty stood up, the limp body
      disposed scientifically across his shoulders. Kitty was quite impressed by
      this exhibition of strength in a man whom she considered as elderly&mdash;old.
      There was an underthought that such feats of bodily prowess were reserved
      for young men. With the naive conceit of twenty-four she ignored the
      actual mathematics of fifty years of clean living and thinking, missed the
      physiological fact that often men at fifty are stronger and tougher than
      men in the twenties. They never waste energy; their precision of movement
      and deliberation of thought conserve the residue against the supreme
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a parenthesis: To a young woman what is a hero? Generally something
      conjured out of a book she has read; the unknown, handsome young man
      across the street; the leading actor in a society drama; the idol of the
      movie. A hero must of necessity be handsome; that is the first essential.
      If he happens to be brave and debonair, rich and aristocratic, so much the
      better. Somehow, to be brave and to be heroic are not actually accepted
      synonyms in certain youthful feminine minds. For instance, every maid will
      agree that her father is brave; but tell her he is a hero because he pays
      his bills regularly and she will accept the statement with a smile of
      tolerant indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Kitty viewed Cutty's activities with a thrill of amazed wonder. Had
      the young man hoisted Cutty to his shoulders her feeling would have been
      one of exultant admiration. Let age crown its garnered wisdom; youth has
      no objections to that; but feats of physical strength&mdash;that is
      poaching upon youth's preserves. Kitty was not conscious of the
      instinctive resentment. At that moment Cutty was to her the most
      extraordinary old man in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I want to know why I am doing this movie stunt.&rdquo;
       The journey began with Kitty in the lead. She prayed that no one would see
      them as they passed the two landing windows. Below and above were vivid
      squares of golden light. She regretted the drizzle; no clothes-laden lines
      intervened to obscure their progress. Someone in the rear of the houses in
      Seventy-ninth Street might observe the silhouettes. The whole affair must
      be carried off secretly or their efforts would come to nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once inside the kitchen Cutty shifted his burden into his arms, the way
      one carries a child, and followed Kitty into the unused bedroom. He did
      not wait for the story, but asked for the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to call for a surgeon at the Lambs. He's just back from France
      and knows a lot about broken heads. And we can trust him absolutely. I
      told him to wait there until I called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cutty, you're a dear. I don't wonder father loved you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently he turned away from the telephone. &ldquo;He'll be here in a jiffy.
      Now, then, what the deuce is all this about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Briefly Kitty narrated the episodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Samaritan stuff. I see. Any absorbent cotton? I can wash the wound after
      a fashion. Warm water and Castile soap. We can have him in shape for
      Harrison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alone, Cutty took note of several apparent facts. The victim's flannel
      shirt was torn at the collar and there were marks of finger nails on the
      throat and chest. Upon close inspection he observed a thin red line round
      the neck&mdash;the mark of a thong. Had they tried to strangle him or had
      he carried something of value? Silk underwear and a clean body; well born;
      foreign. After a conscientious hesitance Cutty went through the pockets.
      All he found were some crumbs of tobacco and a soggy match box. They had
      cleaned him out evidently. There were no tailors' labels in any of the
      pockets; but there were signs that these had once existed. The man on the
      bed had probably ripped them out himself; did not care to be identified.
    </p>
    <p>
      A criminal in flight? Cutty studied the face on the pillow. Shorn of that
      beard it would be handsome; not the type criminal, certainly. A bit of
      natural cynicism edged into his thoughts: Kitty had seen through the
      beard, otherwise she would have turned the affair over to the police. Not
      at all like her mother, yet equally her mother's match in beauty and
      intelligence. Conover's girl, whose eyes had nearly popped out of her head
      at the first sight of those drum-lined walls of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two-Hawks. What was it that was trying to stir in his recollection?
      Two-Hawks. He was sure he had heard that name before. Hawksley meant
      nothing at all; but Two-Hawks possessed a strange attraction. He stared
      off into space. He might have heard the name in a tongue other than
      English.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sound. It came from the lips of the young man. Cutty frowned. The poor
      chap wasn't breathing in a promising way; he groaned after each
      inhalation. And what had become of the old fellow Kitty called Gregory? A
      queer business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty came in with a basin and a roll of absorbent cotton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is groaning!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty rocky condition, I should say. That handkerchief in his cap
      doubtless saved him. Now, little lady, I frankly don't like the idea of
      his being here. Suppose he dies? In that event there'll be the very devil
      to pay. You're all alone here, without even a maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I all alone?&rdquo;&mdash;softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no; come to think of it, I'm no longer your godfather in theory.
      Give me the cotton and hold the basin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was very tender. The wound bled a little; but it was not the kind that
      bled profusely. It was less a cut than a smashing bruise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's all I can do. Who was this tenant Gregory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dear old man. A valet at a Broadway hotel. Oh, I forgot! Johnny
      Two-Hawks called him Stefani Gregor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stefani Gregor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What is it? Why do you say it like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it like what?&rdquo;&mdash;sparring for time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if you had heard the name before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as I thought!&rdquo; cried Cutty, his nimble mind pouncing upon a happy
      invention. &ldquo;You're romantic, Kitty. You're imagining all sorts of nonsense
      about this chap, and you must not let the situation intrigue you. If I
      spoke the name oddly&mdash;this Stefani Gregor&mdash;it was because I
      sensed in a moment that this was a bit of the overflow. Southeastern
      Europe, where the good Samaritan gets kicked instead of thanked. Now,
      here's a good idea. Of course we can't turn this poor chap loose upon the
      public, now that we know his life is in danger. That's always the trouble
      with this Samaritan business. When you commit a fine action you assume an
      obligation. You hoist the Old Man of the Sea on your shoulders, as it
      were. The chap cannot be allowed to remain here. So, if Harrison agrees,
      we'll take him up to my diggings, where no Bolshevik will ever lay eyes
      upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bolshevik?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the sake of a handle. They might be Chinamen, for all I know. I can
      take care of him until he is on his feet. And you will be saved all this
      annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't believe it's going to be an annoyance. I'm terribly
      interested, and want to see it through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he can be moved, out he goes. No arguments. He can't stay in this
      apartment. That's final.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly why not?&rdquo; Kitty demanded, rebelliously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I say so, Kitty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Stefani Gregor an undesirable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew him. What do you say?&rdquo; countered her godfather, evading the
      trap. The innocent child! He smiled inwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty was keen. She sensed an undercurrent, and her first attempt to touch
      it had failed. The mere name of Stefani Gregor had not roused Cutty's
      astonishment. She was quite positive that the name was not wholly
      unfamiliar to her father's friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, something warned her not to press in this direction. He would be on
      the alert. She must wait until he had forgotten the incident. So she drew
      up a chair beside the bed and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty leaned against the footrail, his expression neutral. He sighed
      inaudibly. His delightful catnap was over. Stefani Gregor, Kitty's
      neighbour, a valet in a fashionable hotel! Stefani Gregor, who, upon a
      certain day, had placed the drums of jeopardy in the palms of a war
      correspondent known to his familiars as Cutty. And who was this young man
      on the bed?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes the bell!&rdquo; cried Kitty, jumping up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ring was repeated vigorously and impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, I don't quite like the sound of that bell. Harrison would have no
      occasion to be impatient. Somebody in a hurry. Now, attend to me. I'm
      going to steal out to the kitchen. Don't be afraid. Call if I'm needed.
      Open the door just a crack, with your foot against it. If it's Harrison
      he'll be in uniform. Call out his name. Slam the door if it is someone you
      don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty opened the door as instructed, but she swung it wide because one of
      the men outside was a policeman. The man behind him was a thickset, squat
      individual, with puffed, discoloured eyes and a nose that reminded Kitty
      of an alligator pear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's going on here?&rdquo; the policeman demanded to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2HCH0008" id="link2HCH0008">
      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      A phrase, apparently quite irrelevant to the situation, shot into Kitty's
      head. Moribund perspectives. Instantly she knew, with that foretasting
      mind of hers, that the man peering over the policeman's shoulder and
      Johnny Two-Hawks had met somewhere that day. She was now able to compare
      the results, and she placed the victory on Two-Hawks' brow. Yonder
      individual somehow justified the instinct that had prompted her to play
      the good Samaritan. Whence had this gorilla come? He was not one of the
      men who had issued in such dramatic haste from the Gregor apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man here saw you and another carrying someone across the fire
      escape. What's the rumpus?&rdquo; The policeman was not exactly belligerent, but
      he was dutifully determined. And though he was ready to grant that this
      girl with the Irish eyes was beautiful, a man never could tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's been a tragedy of some kind,&rdquo; began Kitty. &ldquo;This man certainly
      did see us carrying a man across the fire escape. He had been set upon and
      robbed in the apartment across the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you call in the police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he might have died before you got here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the man who helped you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone. He was an outsider. He was afraid of getting mixed up in a police
      affair and ran away.&rdquo; Behind the kitchen door Cutty smiled. She would do,
      this girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds all right,&rdquo; said the policeman. &ldquo;I'll take a look at the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, if you please,&rdquo; said Kitty, readily. &ldquo;You come, too, sir,&rdquo; she
      added as the squat man hesitated. Kitty wanted to watch his expression
      when he saw Johnny Two-Hawks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seed on rocky soil; nothing came of the little artifice. No Buddha's
      graven face was less indicative than the squat man's. Perhaps his face was
      too sore to permit mobility of expression. The drollery of this thought
      caused a quirk in one corner of Kitty's mouth. The squat man stopped at
      the foot of the bed with the air of a mere passer-by and seemed more
      interested in the investigations of the policeman than in the man on the
      bed. But Kitty knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine bang on the coco,&rdquo; was the policeman's observation. &ldquo;Take anything
      out of his pockets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were quite empty. I've sent for a military surgeon. He may arrive at
      any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fellow live across the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the odd part of it. No, he doesn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what was he doing there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably awaiting the return of the real tenant who hasn't returned up to
      this hour&rdquo;&mdash;with an oblique glance at the squat man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind o' queer. Say, you stay here and watch the lady while I scout
      round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squat man nodded and leaned over the foot of the bed. The policeman
      stalked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in the kitchen,&rdquo; said Kitty, confidingly. &ldquo;I saw shadows on the
      window curtain. It did not look right. So I started to inquire and almost
      bumped into two men leaving the apartment. They took to their heels when
      they saw me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the squat man nodded. He appeared to be a good listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you when we crossed the fire escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the yard on the other side of the fence.&rdquo; There was reluctance in the
      guttural voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see. You live there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As this was a supposition and not a direct query, the squat man wagged his
      head affirmatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty, her ears strained for disquieting sounds in the kitchen, laid her
      palm on the patient's cheek. It was very hot. She dipped a bit of cotton
      into the water, which had grown cold, and dampened the wounded man's
      cheeks and throat. Not that she expected to accomplish anything by this
      act; it relieved the nerve tension. This man was no fool. If her surmises
      were correct he was a strong man both in body and in mind. In a rage he
      would be terrible. However, had Johnny Two-Hawks done it&mdash;beaten the
      man and escaped? No doubt he had been watching all the time and had at
      length stepped in to learn if his subordinates had followed his
      instructions and to what extent they had succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he dies it will be murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a big city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so many terrible things happen like this every day. But sooner or
      later those who commit them are found out. Nemesis always follows on the
      heels of vengeance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time there was a flash of interest in the battered eyes of
      the intruder. Perhaps he saw that this was not only a pretty woman but a
      keen one, and sensed the veiled threat. Moreover, he knew that she had
      lied at one point. There had been no light in the room across the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what in the world was happening out there in the kitchen? Kitty
      wondered. So far, not a sound. Had Cutty really taken flight? And why
      shouldn't he have faced it out at her side? Very odd on Cutty's part.
      Shortly she heard the heavy shoes of the policeman returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess it's all right, miss. I'll report the affair at the precinct and
      have an ambulance sent over. You'll have to come along with me, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that legally necessary?&rdquo; asked the squat man, rather perturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. You saw the thing and I verified it,&rdquo; declared the policeman. &ldquo;It
      won't take ten minutes. Your name and address, in case this man dies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty wasn't sure, but the policeman seemed embarrassed about something.
      The directness was gone from his eyes and his speech was no longer brisk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Conover,&rdquo; said Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got that coming in,&rdquo; replied the policeman. &ldquo;We'll be on our way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not once again did the squat man glance at the man on the bed. He followed
      the policeman into the hall, his air that of one who had accepted a
      certain obligation to community welfare and cancelled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty shut the door&mdash;and leaned against it weakly. Where had Cutty
      gone? Even as she expressed the query she smelt burning tobacco. She ran
      out into the kitchen, to behold Cutty seated in a chair calmly smoking his
      infamous pipe!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I thought you were gone! What did you say to that policeman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hypnotized him, Kitty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The newspaper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Just looked into his eye and made a few passes with my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if you believe you ought not to tell me&mdash;&rdquo; said Kitty,
      which is the way all women start their wheedling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty looked into the bowl of his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, when you throw a cobble into a pond, what happens? A splash. But
      did you ever notice the way the ripples have of running on and on, until
      they touch the farthest shore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And this is a ripple from some big stone cast into the pond of
      southeastern Europe. I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just the difficulty. If you understood nothing it would be much
      easier for me. But you know just enough to want to follow up on your own
      hook. I know nothing definitely; I have only suspicions. I calmed that
      policeman by showing him a blanket police power issued by the
      commissioner. I want you to pack up and move out of this neighbourhood.
      It's not congenial to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I can't afford to move until May.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take care of that gladly, to get you out of this garlicky ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Cutty; I'm going to stay here until the lease is up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee-whiz! The Irish are all alike,&rdquo; cried the war correspondent,
      hopelessly. &ldquo;Petticoat or pantaloon, always looking for trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Cutty; simply we don't run away from it. And there's just as much
      Irish in you as there is in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! And for thirty years I've gone hunting for trouble, and never
      failed to find it. I don't like this affair, Kitty; and because I don't
      I'm going to risk my Samson locks in your lily-white hands. I am going to
      tell you two things: I am a secret foreign agent of the United States
      Government. Now don't light up that way. Dark alleys and secret papers and
      beautiful adventuresses and bang-bang have nothing at all to do with my
      job. There isn't a grain of romance in it. Ostensibly I am a war
      correspondent. I have handled all the big events in Serbia and Bulgaria
      and Greece and southwestern Russia. Boiled down, I am a census taker of
      undesirables. Socialist, anarchist and Bolshevik&mdash;I photograph them
      in my mental 'fillums' and transmit to Washington. Thus, when Feodor
      Slopeski lands at Ellis Island with the idea of blowing up New York, he is
      returned with thanks. I didn't ask for the job; it was thrust upon me
      because of my knowledge of the foreign tongues. I accepted it because I am
      a loyal American citizen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you left me because you' didn't know who might be at the door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. I am known in lower New York under another name. I'm a rabid
      internationalist. Down with everything! I don't go out much these days;
      keep under cover as much as I can. Once recognized, my value would be nil.
      In a flannel shirt I'm a dangerous codger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Gregor and this poor young man are in some way mixed up with
      internationalism!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Victims, probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the other thing you wish to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because your eyes are slate blue like your mother's. I loved your mother,
      Kitty,&rdquo; said Cutty, blinking into his pipe. &ldquo;And the singular fact is,
      your father knew but your mother never did. I was never able to tell your
      mother after your father died. Their bodies were separated, but not their
      spirits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty nodded. So that was it? Poor Cutty!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make this confession because I want you to understand my attitude
      toward you. I am going to elect myself as your special guardian so long as
      I'm in New York. From now on, when I ask you to do something, understand
      that I believe it best for you. If my suspicions are correct we are not
      dealing with fools but with madmen. The most dangerous human being, Kitty,
      is an honest man with a half-baked or crooked idea; and that's what this
      world pother, Bolshevism, is&mdash;honest men with crooked ideas, carrying
      the torch of anarchism and believing it enlightenment. What makes them
      tear down things? Every beautiful building is only a monument to their
      former wretchedness; and so they annihilate. None of them actually knows
      what he wants. A thousand will-o'-the-wisps in front of them, and all
      alike. A thousand years to throw off the shackles, and they expect Utopia
      in ten minutes! It makes you want to weep. Socialism&mdash;the brotherhood
      of man&mdash;is a beautiful thing theoretically; but it is like some plays&mdash;they
      read well but do not act. Lopping off heads, believing them to be ideas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it. Though I betray them I pity them. Democracy; slowly and
      surely. As prickly with faults as a cactus pear; but every year there are
      less prickles. We don't stand still or retrogress; we keep going on and
      up. Take this town. Think of It to-day and compare it with the town your
      father knew. There's the bell. I imagine that will be Harrison. If we can
      move this chap will you go to a hotel for the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to stay here, Cutty. That's final.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty sighed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the precinct station the squat man gave a name and an address to the
      bored sergeant at the desk, passed out a cigar, lit one himself, expressed
      some innocuous opinions upon one or two topics of the day, and walked
      leisurely out of the precinct. He wanted to laugh. These pigheads had
      never thought to question his presence in the backyard of the house in
      Seventy-ninth Street. It was the way he had carried himself. Those years
      in New York, prior to the war, had not been wasted. The brass-buttoned
      fools!
    </p>
    <p>
      Serenely unconscious that he was at liberty by explicit orders, because
      the Department of Justice did not care to trap a werewolf before
      ascertaining where the pack was and what the kill, he proceeded leisurely
      to the corner, turned, and broke into a run, which carried him to a drug
      store in Eightieth Street. Here he was joined by two men, apparently coal
      heavers by the look of their hands and faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will take him to a hospital. Find where, then notify me. Remember,
      this is your business, and woe to you if you fail. Where is it?&rdquo; One of
      the men extended an object wrapped in ordinary grocer's paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! That's good. I shall enjoy myself presently. Remember: telephone me
      the moment you learn where they take him. He is still alive, bunglers! And
      you came away empty-handed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was nothing on him. We searched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has hidden them in one of those rooms. I'll attend to that later.
      Watch the hospital for an hour or so, then telephone for information
      regarding his condition. Is that motor for me? Very good. Remember!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inside the taxicab the squat man patted the object on his knees, and
      chuckled from time to time audibly. It would be worth all that journey,
      all he had gone through since dawn that morning. Stefani Gregor! After
      these seven long years&mdash;the man who had betrayed him! To reach into
      his breast and squeeze his heart as one might squeeze a bit of cheese!
      Many things to tell, many pictures to paint. He rode far downtown, wound
      in and out of the warehouse district for a while, then dismissed the taxi
      and proceeded on foot to his destination&mdash;a decayed brick mansion of
      the 40's sandwiched in between two deserted warehouses. In the hall of the
      first landing a man sat in a chair under the gas, reading a newspaper. At
      the approach of the squat man he sprang to his feet, but a phrase
      dissipated his apprehension and he nodded toward a door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unlock it for me and see that I am not disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently the squat man stood inside the room, which was dark. He struck a
      match and peered about for the candle. The light discovered a room barren
      of all furniture excepting the table upon which stood the candle, and a
      single chair. In this chair was a man, bound. He was small and dapper, his
      gray hair swept back a la Liszt. His chin was on his breast, his body
      limp. Apparently the bonds alone held him in the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squat man laid his bundle on the table and approached the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stefani Gregor, look up; it is I!&rdquo; He drummed on his chest like a
      challenging gorilla. &ldquo;I, Boris Karlov!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the eyelids of the prisoner went up, revealing mild blue eyes. But
      almost instantly the mildness was replaced by an agate hardness, and the
      body became upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is Boris, whom you betrayed. But I escaped by a hair, Stefani;
      and we meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What good to tell this poor madman that Stefani Gregor had not betrayed
      him, that he had only warned those marked for death? There was no longer
      reason inside that skull. To die, probably in a few moments. So be it. Had
      he not been ready for seven years? But that poor boy&mdash;to have come
      all these thousands of miles, only to walk into a trap! Had he found that
      note? Had they killed him? Doubtless they had or Boris Karlov would not be
      in this room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We killed him to-night, Stefani, in your rooms. We threw out the food so
      he would have to seek something to eat. The last of that breed, stem and
      branch! We are no longer the mud; we ourselves are the heels. We are
      conquering the world. Today Europe is ours; to-morrow, America!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wintry little smile stirred the lips of the man in the chair. America,
      with its keen perceptions of the ridiculous, its withering humour!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more the dissolute opera dancers will dance to your fiddling, Stefani,
      while we starve in the town. Fiddler, valet, tutor, the rivers and seas of
      Russia are red. We roll east and west, and our emblem is red. Stem and
      branch! We ground our heels in their faces as for centuries they ground
      theirs in ours. He escaped us there&mdash;but I was Nemesis. He died
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The body in the chair relaxed a little. &ldquo;He was clean and honest, Boris. I
      made him so. He would have done fine things if you had let him live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That breed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you yourself loved him when he was a boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stem and branch! I loved my little sister Anna, too. But what did they do
      to her behind those marble walls? Did you fiddle for her? What was she
      when they let her go? My pretty little Anna! The fires of hell for those
      damned green stones of yours, Stefani! She heard of them and wanted to see
      them, and you promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I never promised Anna! ... So that was it? Boris, I only saw her
      there. I never knew what brought her. But the boy was in England then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The breed, the breed!&rdquo; roared the squat man. &ldquo;Ha, but you should have
      seen! Those gay officers and their damned master&mdash;we left them with
      their faces in the mud, Stefani; in the mud! And the women begged. Fine
      music! Those proud hearts, begging Boris Karlov for their lives&mdash;their
      faces in the mud! You, born of us in those Astrakhan Hills, you denied us
      because you liked your fiddle and a full belly, and to play keeper of
      those emeralds. The winding paths of torture and misery and death by which
      they came into the possession of that house! And always the proletariat
      has had to pay in blood and daughters. You, of the people, to betray us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not betray you. I only tried to save those who had been kind to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cunning light shot into Karlov's eyes. &ldquo;The emeralds!&rdquo; He struck his
      pocket. &ldquo;Here, Stefani; and they shall be broken up to buy bread for our
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That poor boy! So he brought them! What are you going to do with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch you grow thin, Stefani. You want death; you shall want food
      instead. Oh, a little; enough to keep you alive. You must learn what it is
      to be hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squat man picked up the bundle from the table and tore off the
      wrapping paper. A violin the colour of old Burgundy lay revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boris!&rdquo; The man in the chair writhed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I waked you, Stefani?&rdquo;&mdash;tenderly. &ldquo;The Stradivarius&mdash;the
      very grand duke of fiddles! And he and his damned officers, how they used
      to call out&mdash;'Get Stefani to fiddle for us!' And you fiddled, dragged
      your genius though the mud to keep your belly warm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save a soul, Boris&mdash;the boy's. When I fiddled his uncle forgot to
      drag him into an orgy. Ah, yes; I fiddled, fiddled because I had promised
      his mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Italian singer! She was lucky to die when she did. She did not see
      the torch, the bayonet, and the mud. But the boy did&mdash;with his
      English accent! How he escaped I don't know; but he died to-night, and the
      emeralds are in my pocket. See!&rdquo; Karlov held the instrument close to the
      other's face. &ldquo;Look at it well, this grand duke of fiddles. Look, fiddler,
      look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The huge hands pressed suddenly. There was brittle crackling, and a rare
      violin became kindling. A sob broke from the prisoner's lips. What to
      Karlov was a fiddle to him was a soul. He saw the madman fling the
      wreckage to the floor and grind his heels into the fragments. Gregor shut
      his eyes, but he could not shut his ears; and he sensed in that cold,
      demoniacal fury of the crunching heel the rising of maddened peoples.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Captain Harrison of the Medical Corps entered the Conover
      apartment briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You old vagabond, what have you been up to? I beg pardon!&rdquo;&mdash;as he
      saw Kitty emerge from behind Cutty's bulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Miss Conover, Harrison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very pleased, I'm sure. Luckily my case was in the coat room at the club.
      I took the liberty of telephoning for Miss Frances, who returned on the
      same ship with me. I concluded that your friend would need a nurse. Let me
      have a look at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Callously but lightly and skillfully the surgeon examined the battered
      head. &ldquo;Escaped concussion by a hair, you might say. Probably had his cap
      on. That black eye, though, is an older affair. Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspect he's some political refugee. We don't know a thing about him
      otherwise. How soon can he be moved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to be moved at once and given the best of care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can give him that in my eagle's nest. Harrison, this chap's life is in
      danger; and if we get him into my lofty diggings they won't be able to
      trace him. Not far from here there's a private hospital I know. It goes
      through from one street to the next. I know the doctor. We'll have the
      ambulance carry the patient there, but at the rear I'll have one of the
      office newspaper trucks. And after a little wait we'll shoot the stretcher
      into the truck. The police will not bother us. I've seen to that. I rather
      believe it falls in with some of my work. The main idea, of course, is to
      rid Miss Conover of any trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you say,&rdquo; agreed the surgeon. &ldquo;That's all I can do for the
      present. I'll run down to the entrance and wait for The nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he live?&rdquo; asked Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he will. He is in good physical condition. Imagine he has
      simply been knocked out. Serious only if unattended. Your finding him
      probably saved him. Twelve hours will tell the story. May be on his feet
      inside a week. Still, it would be advisable to keep him in bed as long as
      possible. Fagged out, I should say, from that beard. I'll go down and wait
      for Miss Frances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ring three times when you return,&rdquo; advised Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Did they try to strangle him or did he have something round
      his neck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hanged if I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All out of the room now. I want it dark. Just as soon as the nurse
      arrives I'll return. Three rings.&rdquo; Harrison left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty spent a few minutes at the telephone, then he joined Kitty in the
      living room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, what was the stranger like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a gorilla. He spoke English as if he had a cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty scowled into space. &ldquo;Have a scar over an eyebrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, I couldn't tell! Both his eyes were black and his nose
      banged dreadfully. Johnny Two-Hawks probably did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully for Two-Hawks! Kitty, you're a marvel. Not a flivver from the
      start. And those slate-blue eyes of yours don't miss many things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she interrupted, taking hold of his sleeve. &ldquo;Hear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the Elevated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tumpitum-tump! Tumpitum-tump! Cutty, you hypnotized me this afternoon
      with your horrid drums.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The emeralds?&rdquo; He managed to repress the start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what it is; drums, anyhow. Maybe it is the emeralds.
      Something has been happening ever since you told me about them&mdash;the
      misery and evil that follow their wake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the story goes that women are immune, Kitty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! No woman is immune where a wonderful gem is concerned. And yet
      I've common sense and humour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a lot more besides, Kitty. You're a raving, howling little beauty;
      and how you've remained out of captivity this long is a puzzler to me.
      Haven't you got a beau somewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Cutty. Perhaps I'm one of those who are quite willing to wait
      patiently. If the one I want doesn't come&mdash;why, I'll be a jolly,
      philosophical old maid. No seconds or culls for me, as the magazine editor
      says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly what do you want?&rdquo; Cutty was keenly curious, for some reason he
      could not define. He did not care for diamonds as stones; but he admired
      any personality that flashed differently from each new angle exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a man, among other things. I don't mean one of those godlike chromos
      in the frontispiece of popular novels. He hasn't got to be handsome. But
      he must be able to laugh when he's happy, when he's hurt. I must be his
      business in life. He must know a lot about things I know. I want a comrade
      who will come to me when he has a joke or an ache. A gay man and
      whimsical. The law can make any man a husband, but only God can make a
      good comrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; said Cutty, his fine eyes sparkling, &ldquo;I shan't have to watch over
      you so much as I thought. On the other hand, you have described me to a
      dot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite possibly. Vanity has its uses. It keeps us in contact with bathtubs
      and nice clothes. I imagine that you would make both husband and comrade;
      or you would have, twenty years ago&rdquo;&mdash;without intentional cruelty.
      Wasn't Cutty fifty-two?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, you've touched a vital point. It took those twenty years to make
      me companionable. Experience is something we must buy; it isn't left in
      somebody's will. Let us say that I possess all the necessary attributes
      save one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Youth, Kitty. And take the word of a senile old dotard, your young man,
      when you find him, will lack many of the attributes you require. On the
      other hand, there is always the possibility that these will develop as you
      jog along. The terrible pity of youth is that it has the habit of
      conferring these attributes rather than finding them. You put garlands on
      the heads of snow images, and the first glare of sunshine&mdash;pouf!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cutty, I'm beginning to like you immensely&rdquo;&mdash;smiling. &ldquo;Perhaps women
      ought to have two husbands&mdash;one young and handsome and the other old
      and wise like yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty wished he were alone in order to analyze the stab. Old! When he knew
      that mentally and physically he could take and break a dozen Two-Hawks.
      Old! He had never thought himself that. Fifty-two years; they had piled up
      on him without his appreciation of the fullness of the score. And yet he
      was more than a match for any ordinary man of thirty in sinew and brain;
      and no man met the new morning with more zest than he himself met it. But
      to Kitty he was old! Lavender and oak leaves were being draped on his door
      knob. He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you laugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because&mdash;Hark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two of them ran to the bedroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olga! Olga!&rdquo; And then a guttural level jumble of sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's quick brain reached out for a similitude&mdash;water rushing over
      ragged boulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olga!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;He is a Russian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are Serbian Olgas and Bulgarian Olgas and Rumanian Olgas. Probably
      his sweetheart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds like Russian,&rdquo; added Cutty, his conscience pricking him. But he
      welcomed that &ldquo;Olga.&rdquo; It would naturally put a damper on Kitty's interest.
      &ldquo;There's Harrison with the nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarter of an hour later the patient was taken down to the ambulance and
      conveyed to the private hospital. Cutty had no way of ascertaining whether
      they were followed; but he hoped they would be. The knowledge that their
      victim was in a near-by hospital would naturally serve to relax the enemy
      vigilance temporarily; and this would permit safely and secretly the
      second leg of the journey&mdash;that to his own apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to let an hour go past; then Two-Hawks was taken through the
      building to the rear and transferred to the truck. Cutty sat with the
      driver while Captain Harrison and the nurse rode inside with the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way Cutty was rather disturbed by the deep impression Kitty Conover
      had made upon his heart and mind. That afternoon he had looked upon her
      with fatherly condescension, as the pretty daughter of the two he had
      loved most. From the altitude of his fifty-two he had gazed down upon her
      twenty-four, weighing her as like all young women of twenty-four&mdash;pleasure-loving
      and beau-hunting and fashion-scorched; and in a flash she had revealed the
      formed mind of a woman of thirty. Altitude. He had forgotten that relative
      to altitudes there are always two angles of vision&mdash;that from the
      summit and that from the green valley below. Kitty saw him beyond the tree
      line, but just this side of the snows&mdash;and matched his condescension
      with pity! He chuckled. Doddering old ass, what did it matter how she
      looked at him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beautiful and young and full of common sense, yet dangerously romantical.
      To wait for the man she wanted, what did that signify but romance? And
      there was her Irish blood to consider. The association of pretty nurse and
      interesting patient always afforded excellent background for sentimental
      nonsense, the obligations of the one and the gratitude of the other. Well,
      he had nipped that in the bud.
    </p>
    <p>
      And why hadn't he taken this Two-Hawks person&mdash;how easy it was to
      fall into Kitty's way of naming the chap!&mdash;why hadn't he taken him
      directly to the Roosevelt? Why all this pother and secrecy over a total
      stranger? Stefani Gregor, who lived opposite Kitty and who hadn't
      prospered particularly since the day he had exhibited the drums of
      jeopardy&mdash;he was the reason. These were volcanic days, and a friend
      of Stefani Gregor&mdash;who played the violin like Paganini&mdash;might
      well be worth the trouble of a little courtesy. Then, too, there was that
      mark of the thong&mdash;a charm, a military identification disk or
      something of value. Whatever it was, the rogues had got it. Murder and
      loot. And as soon as he returned to consciousness the young fellow would
      be making inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Kitty's point of view regarding a certain duffer aged fifty-two
      was nearer the truth than the duffer himself realized. Second childhood!
      As if the drums of jeopardy would ever again see light, after that tempest
      of fire and death&mdash;that mud volcano!
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing was certain&mdash;there would be no more cat-napping. The game
      was on again. He was assured of that side of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green stones, the sunlight breaking against the flaws in a shower of
      golden sparks; green as the pulp of a Champagne grape; the drums of
      jeopardy! Murder and loot; he could understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after the patient was put to bed Cutty changed. A nondescript
      suit of the day-labourer type and a few deft touches of coal dust
      completed his make-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan't be back until morning,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Work to do. Kuroki will
      be at your service through the night, Miss Frances. Strike that Burmese
      gong once, at any hour. Come along, Harrison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want any company?&rdquo; asked Harrison, with a belligerent twist to his
      moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty laughed. &ldquo;No. You run along to your lambs. I'm running with the
      wolves to-night, old scout, and you might get that spick-and-span uniform
      considerably mussed up. Besides, it's raining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what's to become of Miss Conover? She ought not to remain alone in
      that apartment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! I thought of that, too. But she can take care of herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those ruffians may call up the hospital and learn that we tricked them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try to force the truth from Miss Conover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's precisely the wherefore of this coal dust. On your way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eleven o'clock. Kitty was in the kitchen, without light, her chair by the
      window, which she had thrown up. She had gone to bed, but sleep was
      impossible. So she decided to watch the Gregor windows. Sometimes the mind
      is like a movie camera set for a double exposure. The whole scene is
      visible, but the camera sees only half of it. Thus, while she saw the
      windows across the court there entered the other side of her mind a
      picture of the immaculate Cutty crossing the platform with Johnny
      Two-Hawks thrown over his shoulder. The mental picture obscured the
      actual.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had called him old. Well, he was old. And no doubt he looked upon her
      as a child, wanting her to spend the night at a hotel! The affair was
      over. No one would bother Kitty Conover. Why should they? But it took
      strength to shoulder a man like that. What fun he and her father must have
      had together! And Cutty had loved her mother! That made Kitty exquisitely
      tender for a moment. All alone, at the age when new friendships were
      impossible. A lovable man like that going down through life alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      Census taker of alien undesirables; a queer occupation for a man so famous
      as Cutty. Patriotism&mdash;to plunge into that seething revolutionary scum
      to sort the dangerous madmen from the harmless mad-men. Courage and
      strength and mental resource; yes, Cutty possessed these; and he would be
      the kind to laugh at a joke or a hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing, however, was indelibly printed on her mind. Stefani Gregor&mdash;either
      Cutty had met and known the man or he had heard of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she became conscious that she was blinking as one blinks from
      mirror-reflected sunlight. She cast about for the source of this
      phenomenon. Obliquely from between the interstices of the fire-escape
      platform came a point of moving white light. She craned her neck. A
      battery lamp! The round spot of light worked along the cement floor,
      vanished occasionally, reappeared, and then vanished altogether. Somebody
      was down there hunting for something. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty remained with her head out of the window for some time, unmindful of
      the spatter of rain. But nothing happened. The man was gone. Of course the
      incident might not have the slightest bearing upon the previous adventures
      of this amazing night; still, it was suggestive. The young man had worn
      something round his neck. But if his enemies had it why should this man
      comb the court, unless he was a tenant and had knocked something off a
      window ledge?
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to appreciate that she was very tired, and decided to go back to
      bed. This time she fell asleep. Her disordered thoughts rearranged
      themselves in a dazzling dream. She found herself wandering through a
      glorious translucent green cavern&mdash;a huge emerald. And in the
      distance she heard that unmistakable tumpitum-tump! tumpitum-tump! It drew
      her irresistibly. She fought and struggled against the fascinating sound,
      but it continued to draw her on. Suddenly from round a corner came the
      squat man, his hair a la Fuzzy-Wuzzy. He caught her savagely by the
      shoulder and dragged her toward a fire of blazing diamonds. On the other
      side of that fire was a blonde young woman with a tiara of rubies on her
      head. &ldquo;Save me! I am Olga, Olga!&rdquo; Kitty struggled fiercely and awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light was on. At the side of her bed were two men. One of them was
      holding her bare shoulder and digging his fingers into it cruelly. They
      looked like coal heavers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not wish to harm you, and won't if you're sensible. Where did they
      take the man you brought?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kitty did not wrench herself loose at once. She wasn't quite sure that
      this was not a continuance of her nightmare. She knew that nightmares had
      a way of breaking off in the middle of things, of never arriving anywhere.
      The room looked natural enough and the pain in her shoulder seemed real
      enough, but one never could tell. She decided to wait for the next
      episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer!&rdquo; cried the spokesman of the two, twisting Kitty's shoulder.
      &ldquo;Where did they take him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Awake! Kitty wrenched her shoulder away and swept the bedclothes up to her
      chin. She was thoroughly frightened, but her brain was clear. The spark of
      self-preservation flew hither and about in search of expediencies,
      temporizations. She must come through this somehow with the vantage on her
      side. She could not possibly betray that poor young man, for that would
      entail the betrayal of Cutty also. She saw but one avenue, the telephone;
      and these two men were on the wrong side of the bed, between her and the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Her throat was so dry she wondered whether the words
      were projected far enough for them to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want the address of the wounded man you brought into this apartment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They took him to a hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was taken away from there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was. You may not know where, but you will know the address of the
      man who tricked us; and that will be sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The army surgeon? He was called in by chance. I don't know where he
      lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man in the dress suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was with the surgeon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came first. Come; we have no time to waste. We don't want to hurt you,
      and we hope you will not force us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you step out of the room while I dress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Tell us where the man lives, and you can have the whole apartment to
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak English very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! Do you want us to bundle you up in the bedclothes and carry you
      off? It will not be a pleasant experience for a pretty young woman like
      yourself. Something happened to the man you knew as Gregory. Will that
      make you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what abduction means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your police will not catch us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I might give you the wrong address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try it and see what happens. Young lady, this is a bad affair for a woman
      to be mixed up in. Be sensible. We are in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you seem to have acquired at least one American habit!&rdquo; said a
      gruff voice from the bedroom doorway. &ldquo;Raise your hands quickly, and don't
      turn,&rdquo; went on the gruff voice. &ldquo;If I shoot it will be to kill. It is a
      rough game, as you say. That's it; and keep them up. Now, then, young
      lady, slip on your kimono. Get up and search these men. I'm in a hurry,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty obeyed, very lovely in her dishevelment. Repugnant as the task was
      she disarmed the two men and flung their weapons on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now something to tie their hands; anything that will hold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty could see the speaker now. Another coal heaver, but evidently on her
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tie their hands behind them... I warn you not to move, men. When I say
      I'll shoot I mean it. Don't be afraid of hurting them, miss. Very good.
      Now bandage their eyes. Handkerchiefs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Kitty's handkerchiefs did not run to the dimensions' required; so she
      ripped up a petticoat. Torn between her eagerness to complete a
      disagreeable task and her offended modesty, Kitty went through the
      performance with creditable alacrity. Then she jumped back into bed,
      doubled her knees, and once more drew up the bedclothes to her chin,
      content to be a spectator, her eyes as wide as ever they possibly could
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some secret-service man Cutty had sent to protect her. Dear old Cutty!
      Small wonder he had urged her to spend the night at a hotel. The
      admiration of her childhood returned, but without the shackles of shyness.
      She had always trusted him absolutely, and to this trust was now added
      understanding. To have him pop into her life again in this fashion, all
      the ordinary approaches to intimacy wiped out by these amazing episodes;
      the years bridged in an hour! If only he were younger!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch them, miss. Don't be afraid to shoot. I'll return in a moment&rdquo;&mdash;still
      gruffly. The secret-service man pushed his prisoners into chairs and left
      the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty did not care how gruff the voice was; it was decidedly pleasant in
      her ears. Gingerly she picked up one of the revolvers. Kitty Conover with
      shooting irons in her hands, like a movie actress! She heard a whistle.
      After this an interval of silence, save for the ticking of the alarm clock
      on the stand. She eyed the blindfolded men speculatively, swung out of
      bed, and put on her stockings and sandals; then she sat on the edge of the
      bed and waited for the sequence. Kitty Conover was going to have some
      queer recollections to tell her grandchildren, providing she had any. That
      morning she had risen to face a humdrum normal day. And here she was, at
      midnight, hobnobbing with quiescent murder and sudden death! To-morrow
      Burlingame would ask her to hustle up the Sunday stuff, and she would
      hustle. She wanted to laugh, but was a little afraid that this laughter
      might degenerate into incipient hysteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still in her mind a vivid recollection of her dream&mdash;the
      fire of diamonds and the blonde girl with the tiara of rubies. Olga, Olga!
      Russian; the whole affair was Russian. She shivered. Always that land and
      people had appeared to her in sinister aspect; no doubt an impression
      acquired from reading melodramas written by Englishmen who, once upon a
      time, had given Russia preeminence as a political menace. Russia, in all
      things&mdash;music, art, literature&mdash;the tragic note. Stefani Gregor
      and Johnny Two-Hawks had roused the enmity of some political society with
      this result. Nihilist or Bolshevist or socialist, there was little choice;
      and Cutty sensibly did not want her drawn into the whirlpool.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a pleasant intimacy hers and Cutty's promised to be! And if he hadn't
      casually dropped into the office that afternoon she would have surrendered
      the affair to the police, and that would have been the end of it. Amazing
      thought&mdash;you might jog along all your life at the side of a person
      and never know him half so well as someone you met m a tense episode, like
      that of the immaculate Cutty crossing the fire escape with Two-Hawks on
      his shoulders!
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard the friendly coal heaver going down the corridor to the door.
      When he returned to the bedroom two men accompanied him. Not a word was
      said. The two men marched off with the prisoners and left Kitty alone with
      her saviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor little chicken, did you believe I had deserted you?&rdquo; The voice
      wasn't gruff now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cutty?&rdquo; Kitty ran to him, flinging her arms round his neck. &ldquo;Oh, Cutty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty's heart, which had bumped along an astonishing number of million
      times in fifty-two years, registered a memorable bump against his ribs.
      The touch of her soft arms and the faint, indescribable perfume which
      emanates from a dainty woman's hair thrilled him beyond any thrill he had
      ever known. For Kitty's mother had never put her arms round old Cutty's
      neck. Of course he understood readily enough: Molly's girl, flesh of her
      flesh. And she had rushed to him as she would have rushed to her father.
      He patted her shoulder clumsily, still a little dazzled for all the
      revelation in the analysis. The sweet intimacy of it! The door of Paradise
      opened for a moment, and then shut in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not recognize you at all!&rdquo; she cried, standing off. &ldquo;I shouldn't
      have known you on the street. And it is so simple. What a wonderful man
      you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For an old codger?&rdquo; Cutty's heart registered another sizable bump.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty laughed. &ldquo;Never call yourself old to me again. Are you always doing
      these things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I keep moving. I suspected something like this might happen. Those
      two will go to the Tombs to await deportation if they are aliens. Perhaps
      we can dig something out of them relative to this man Gregor. Anyhow,
      we'll try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cutty, I saw a man in the court with a pocket lamp before I went to bed.
      He was hunting for something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't find anything but a lot of fresh food someone had thrown out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was you, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There was a vague possibility that your protege might have thrown
      out something valuable during the struggle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord knows! A queer business, Kitty, you've lugged me into&mdash;my own!
      And there is one thing I want you to remember particularly: Life means
      nothing to the men opposed, neither chivalry nor ethics. Annihilation is
      their business. They don't want civilization; they want chaos. They have
      lost the sense of comparisons or they would not seek to thrust Bolshevism
      down the throats of the rest of the world. They say democracy has failed,
      and their substitute is murder and loot. Kitty, I want you to leave this
      roost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall stay until my lease expires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? In the face of real danger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I intend to, Cutty&mdash;unless you kidnap me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any good reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll laugh; but something tells me to stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Cutty did not laugh. &ldquo;Very well. Tomorrow an assistant janitor will be
      installed. His name is Antonio Bernini. Every night he will whistle up the
      tube. Whistle back. If you are going out for the evening notify him where
      you intend to go and when you expect to be back. A wire from your bed to
      his cot will be installed. In danger, press the button. That's the best I
      can do for you, since you decide to stick. I don't believe anything more
      will happen to-night, but from now on you will be watched. Never come
      directly to my apartment. Break your journey two or three times with
      taxis. Always use Elevator Four. The boy is mine; belongs to the service.
      So our Bolshevik friends won't gather anything about you from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, Cutty had now come to the conviction that it would be
      well to let Kitty remain here as a lure. He had urged her to leave, and
      she had refused, so his conscience was tolerably clear. Besides, she would
      henceforth be guarded with a ceaseless efficiency second only to that
      which encompasses a President of the United States. Always some man of the
      service would be watching those who watched her. This was going to develop
      into a game of small nets, one or two victims at a time. Because these
      enemies of civilization lacked coherence in action there would be slim
      chance of rounding them up in bulk. But from now on men would vanish&mdash;one
      here, a pair there, perhaps on occasion four or five. And those who had
      known them would know them no more. The policy would be that employed by
      the British in the submarine campaign&mdash;mysterious silence after the
      evanishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all so exciting!&rdquo; said Kitty. &ldquo;But that poor old man Gregor! He had
      a wonderful violin, Cutty; and sometimes I used to hear him play folklore
      music&mdash;sad, haunting melodies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll know in a little while what's become of him. I doubt there is a
      foreign organization in the city that hasn't one or more of our men on the
      inside. A word will be dropped somewhere. I'm rarely active on this side
      of the Atlantic; and what I'm doing now is practically due to interest.
      But every active operative in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago
      is on the lookout for a man who, if left free, will stir up a lot of
      trouble. He has leadership, this Boris Karlov, a former intimate here of
      Trotzky's. We have reason to believe that he slipped through the net in
      San Francisco. Probably under a cleverly forged passport. Now please
      describe the man who came in with the policeman. I haven't had time to
      make inquiries at the precinct, where they will have a minute description
      of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He made me think of a gorilla, just as I told you. His face was pretty
      well banged up. Naturally I did not notice any scar. A dreadfully black
      beard, shaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squat, powerful, like a gorilla. Lord, I wish I'd had a glimpse of him!
      He's one of the few topnotchers I haven't met. He's the spark, the hand on
      the plunger. The powder is all ready in this land of ours; our job is to
      keep off the sparks until we can spread the stuff so it will only go puff
      instead of bang. This man Karlov is bad medicine for democracy. Poor
      devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I'm honestly sorry for them. This fellow Karlov has suffered. He
      is now a species of madman nothing will cure. He and his kind have gained
      their ends in Russia, but the impetus to kill and burn and loot is still
      unchecked. Sorry, yes; but we can't have them here. They remind me of
      nothing so much as those blind deep-sea monsters in one of Kipling's
      tales, thrown up into air and sunlight by a submarine volcano, slashing
      and bellowing. But we can't have them here any longer. Keep those
      revolvers under your pillow. All you have to do is to point. Nobody will
      know that you can't shoot. And always remember, we're watching over you.
      Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mouquin's for lunch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be hanged! But it can't be, Kitty. You and I must not be seen
      in public. If that was Karlov you will be marked, and so will any one who
      travels with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fact. But come up to the roost&mdash;changing taxis&mdash;to-morrow at
      five and have tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down in the street Cutty bore into the slanting rain, no longer a drizzle.
      With his hands jammed in his side pockets and his gaze on the sparkling
      pavement he continued downtown, in a dangerously ruminative frame of mind,
      dangerous because had he been followed he would not have known it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly Conover's girl! That afternoon it had been Tommy Conover's girl; now
      she was Molly's. It occurred to him for the first time that he was one of
      those unfortunate individuals who are always able to open the door to
      Paradise for others and are themselves forced to remain outside. Hadn't he
      introduced Conover to Molly, and hadn't they fallen in love on the spot?
      Too old to be a hero and not old enough to die. He grinned. Some day he
      would use that line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it wasn't Kitty who set this peculiar cogitation in motion. It
      wasn't her arms and the perfume of her hair. The actual thrill had come
      from a recrudescence of a vanished passion; anyhow, a passion that had
      been held suspended all these years. Still, it offered a disquieting
      prospect. He was sensible enough to realize that he would be in for some
      confusion in trying to disassociate the phantom from the quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most pretty young women were flitter-flutters, unstable, shallow,
      immature. But this little lady had depth, the sense of the living drama;
      and, Lord, she was such a beauty! Wanted a man who would laugh when he was
      happy and when he was hurt. A bull's-eye&mdash;bang, like that! For the
      only breed worth its salt was the kind that laughed when happy and when
      hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The average young woman, rushing into his arms the way she had, would not
      have stirred him in the least. And immediately upon the heels of this
      thought came a taste of the confusion he saw in store for himself. Was it
      the phantom or Kitty? He jumped to another angle to escape the impasse.
      Kitty's coming to him in that fashion raised an unpalatable suggestion. He
      evidently looked fatherly, no matter how he felt. Hang these fifty-two
      years, to come crowding his doorstep all at once!
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his head and laughed. He suddenly remembered now. At nine that
      night he had been scheduled to deliver a lecture on the Italo-Jugoslav
      muddle before a distinguished audience in the ballroom of a famous hotel!
      He would have some fancy apologizing to do in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped into a doorway, then peered out cautiously. There was not a
      single pedestrian in sight. No need of hiking any further in this rain; so
      he hunted for a taxi. To-morrow he would set the wires humming relative to
      old Stefani Gregor. Boris Karlov, if indeed it were he, would lead the
      way. Hadn't Stefani and Boris been boyhood friends, and hadn't Stefani
      betrayed the latter in some political affair? He wasn't sure; but a glance
      among his 1912 notes would clear up the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that young chap! Who was he? Cutty set his process of logical
      deduction moving. Karlov&mdash;always supposing that gorilla was Karlov&mdash;had
      come in from the west. So had the young man. Gregor's inclinations had
      been toward the aristocracy; at least, that had been the impression. A
      Bolshevik would not seek haven with a man like Gregor, as this young man
      had. But Two-Hawks bothered him; the name bothered him, because it had no
      sense either in English or in Russian. And yet he was sure he had heard it
      somewhere. Perhaps his notes would throw some light on that subject, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arrived home Miss Frances, the nurse, informed him that the
      patient was babbling in an outlandish tongue. For a long time Cutty stood
      by the bedside, translating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olga!... Olga!... And she gave me food, Stefani, this charming American
      girl. Never must we forget that. I was hungry, and she gave me food....
      But I paid for it. You, gone, there was no one else.... And she is
      poor.... The torches!... I am burning, burning!... Olga!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo; asked the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Russian. Is it a crisis?&rdquo; he evaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not necessarily. Doctor Harrison said he would probably return to
      consciousness sometime to-morrow. But he must have absolute quiet. No
      visitors. A bad blow, but not of fatal consequence. I've seen hundreds of
      cases much worse pull out in a fortnight. You'd better go to bed, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Cutty, gratefully. He was tired. The ball did not
      rebound as it used to; the resilience was petering out. But look alive,
      there! Big events were toward, and he must not stop to feel of his pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three o'clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the Gregor bedroom sat down on the bed, the pocket lamp
      dangling from his hairy fingers. Not a nook or cranny in the apartment had
      he overlooked. In every cupboard, drawer; in the beds and under; the
      trunks; behind the radiators and the pictures; the shelves and clothes in
      the closets. What he sought he had not found.
    </p>
    <p>
      His vengeance would not be complete without those green stones in his
      hands. Anna would call from her grave. Pretty little Anna, who had trusted
      Stefani Gregor, and gone to her doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these thousands of miles, by hook and crook, by forged passports, by
      sums of money, sleepless nights and hungry days&mdash;for this! The last
      of that branch of the breed out of his reach, and the stones vanished! A
      queer superstition had taken lodgment in his brain; he recognized it now
      for the first time. The possession of those stones would be a sign from
      God to go on. Green stones for bread! Green stones for bread! The drums of
      jeopardy! In his hands they would be talismanic.
    </p>
    <p>
      But wait! That pretty girl across the way. Supposing he had intrusted the
      stones to her? Or hidden them there without her being aware of it?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kitty Conover ate in the kitchen. First off, this statement is likely to
      create the false impression that there was an ordinary grain here, a wedge
      of base hemlock in the citron. Not so. She ate in the kitchen because she
      could not yet face that vacant chair in the dining room without choking
      and losing her appetite. She could not look at the chair without
      visualizing that glorious, whimsical, fascinating mother of hers, who
      could turn grumpy janitors into comedians and send importunate bill
      collectors away with nothing but spangles in their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      So long as she stayed out of the dining room she could accept her
      loneliness with sound philosophy. She knew, as all sensible people know,
      that there were ghosts, that memory had haunted galleries, and that empty
      chairs were evocations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her days were so busily active, there were so many first nights and
      concerts, that she did not mind such evenings as she had to spend alone in
      the apartment. Persons were in and out of the office all through the day,
      and many of them entertaining. For only real persons ever penetrated that
      well-guarded cubby-hole off the noisy city room. Many of them were old
      friends of her mother. Of course they were a little pompous, but this was
      less innate than acquired; and she knew that below they were worth while.
      She had come to the conclusion that successful actors and actresses were
      the only people in America who spoke English fluently and correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she ate in the kitchen; but she would have been a fit subject for the
      fastidious Fragonard. Kitty was naturally an exquisite. Everything about
      her was dainty, her body and her mind. The background of pans and dishes,
      gas range and sink did not absorb Kitty; her presence here in the morning
      lifted everything out of the rut of commonplace and created an atmosphere
      that was ornamental. Pink peignoir and turquoise-blue boudoir cap, silk
      petticoat and stockings and adorable little slippers. No harm to tell the
      secret! Kitty was educating herself for a husband. She knew that if she
      acquired the habit of daintiness at breakfast before marriage it would
      become second nature after marriage. Moreover, she was determined that it
      should be tremendous news that would cause a newspaper to intervene. She
      had all the confidence in the world in her mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got her breakfast this morning, singing. She was happy. She had found
      a door out of monotony; theatrical drama had given way to the living. She
      had opened the book of adventure and she was going straight through to
      finis. That there was an undertow of the sinister escaped her or she
      ignored it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all high-strung Irish souls there is a bit of the old wife, the
      foreteller; the gift of prescience; and Kitty possessed this in a mild
      degree. Something held her here, when for a dozen reasons she should have
      gone elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      She strained the coffee, humming a tune out of The Mikado, the revival of
      which she had seen lately:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 My object all sublime
                I shall achieve in time
         To make the punishment fit the crime.
             The punishment fit the crime.
              And make the prisoner pent
                 Unwillingly represent
            A source of innocent merriment.
                Of innocent merriment!
</pre>
    <p>
      And there you were! To make the punishment fit the crime. Wall in the
      Bolsheviki, the I.W.W.'s, the Red Socialist, the anarchists&mdash;and let
      them try it for ten years. Those left would be glad enough to embrace
      democracy and sanity. The poor benighted things, to imagine that they were
      going forward there in Russia! What kind of mentality was it that could
      conceive a blessing to humanity in the abolition of baths and work? And
      Cutty felt sorry for them. Well, as for that, so did Kitty Conover; and
      she would continue feeling sorry for them so long as they remained
      thousands of miles away. But next door!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grapefruit, eggs on toast, and coffee; mademoiselle is served!&rdquo; she
      cried, gayly, sitting down and attacking her breakfast with the zest of
      healthy youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often the eyes are like the lenses of a camera minus the sensitized plate;
      they see objects without printing them. Thus a dozen times Kitty's glance
      absently swept the range and the racks on each side of the stovepipe, one
      rack burdened with an empty pancake jug and the other cluttered with
      old-fashioned flatirons; but she saw nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was carefully reviewing the events of the night before. She could not
      dismiss the impression that Cutty knew Stefani Gregor or had heard of him;
      and in either case it signified that Gregor was something more than a
      valet. And decidedly Two-Hawks was not of the Russian peasantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time she was ready to leave for the office the Irish blood in her
      was seething and bubbling and dancing. She knew she would do crazy,
      impulsive things all day. It was easy to analyze this exuberance. She had
      reached out into the dark and touched danger, and found a new thrill in a
      humdrum world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Great Dramatist had produced a tremendous drama and she had watched
      curtain after curtain fall from the wrong side of the lights. Now she had
      been given a speaking part; and she would be down stage for a moment or
      two&mdash;dusting the furniture&mdash;while the stars were retouching
      their make-up. It was not the thought of Cutty, of Gregor, of Johnny
      Two-Hawks, of hidden treasure; simply she had arrived somewhere in the
      great drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she reached the office she had a hard time of it to settle down to
      the day's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hustle up that Sunday stuff,&rdquo; said Burlingame. Kitty laughed. Just as she
      had pictured it. She hustled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; she cried, breaking a spell of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;St. Vitus?&rdquo; inquired Burlingame, patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the Morgue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the dickens&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Kitty was no longer there to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all newspaper offices there is a department flippantly designated as
      the Morgue. Obituaries on ice, as it were. A photograph or an item
      concerning a great man, a celebrated, beauty or some notorious rogue; from
      the king calibre down to Gyp-the-Blood brand, all indexed and laid away
      against the instant need. So, running her finger tip down the K's, Kitty
      found Karlov. The half tone which she eventually exhumed from the tin box
      was an excellent likeness of the human gorilla who had entered her rooms
      with the policeman. She would be able to carry this positive information
      to Cutty that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she left the office at four she took the Subway to Forty-second
      Street. She engaged a taxi from the Knickerbocker and discharged it at the
      north entrance to the Waldorf, which she entered. She walked through to
      the south entrance and got into another taxi. She left this at
      Wanamaker's, ducking and dodging through the crowded aisles. She selected
      this hour because, being a woman, she knew that the press of shoppers
      would be the greatest during the day. Karlov's man and the secret-service
      operative detailed by Cutty both made the same mistake&mdash;followed
      Kitty into the dry-goods shop and lost her as completely as if she had
      popped up in China. At quarter to five she stepped into Elevator Number
      Four of the building which Cutty called his home, very well pleased with
      herself.

      To understand Kitty at this moment one must be able to understand the
      Irish; and nobody does or can or will. Consider her twenty-four years, her
      corpuscular inheritance, the love of drama and the love of adventure.
      Imagine possessing sound ideas of life and the ability to apply them, and
      spiritually always galloping off on some broad highway&mdash;more often
      than not furnished by some engaging scoundrel of a novelist&mdash;and you
      will be able to construct a half tone of Kitty Conover.
    </p>
    <p>
      That civilization might be actually on its deathbed, that positively half
      of the world was starving and dying and going mad through the reaction of
      the German blight touched her in a detached way. She felt sorry,
      dreadfully sorry, for the poor things; but as she could not help them she
      dismissed them from her thoughts every morning after she had read the
      paper, the way most of us do here in these United States. You cannot
      grapple with the misery of an unknown person several thousand miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      That which had taken place during the past twenty-four hours was to her a
      lark, a blindman's buff for grown-ups. It was not in her to tremble, to
      shudder, to hesitate, to weigh this and to balance that. Irish curiosity.
      Perhaps in the original that immortal line read: &ldquo;The Irish rush in where
      angels fear to tread,&rdquo; and some proofreader had a particular grudge
      against the race.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the elevator reached the seventeenth floor, the passengers surged
      forth. All except Kitty, who tarried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't carry to the eighteenth, miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Miss Conover,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I dared not tell you until we were
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; The boy nodded, swept her with an appraising glance, and sent the
      elevator up to the loft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand? If any one inquires about me, you don't remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, miss. The boss's orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if any one does inquire you are to report at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy rolled back the door and Kitty stepped out upon a Laristan runner
      of rose hues and cobalt blue. She wondered what it cost Cutty to keep up
      an establishment like this. There were fourteen rooms, seven facing the
      north and seven facing the west, with glorious vistas of steam-wreathed
      roofs and brick Matterhorns and the dim horizon touching the sea. Fine
      rugs and tapestries and furniture gathered from the four ends of the
      world; but wholly livable and in no sense atmospheric of the museum. Cutty
      had excellent taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had visited the apartment but twice before, once in her childhood and
      again when she was eighteen. Cutty had given a dinner in honour of her
      mother's birthday. She smiled as she recalled the incident. Cutty had
      placed a box of candles at the side of her mother's plate and told her to
      stick as many into the cake as she thought best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Cutty, emerging from one of the doors. &ldquo;What the dickens
      have you been up to? My man has just telephoned me that he lost track of
      you in Wanamaker's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty explained, delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! If you can lose a man such as I set to watch you, you'll have
      no trouble shaking the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Karlov, Cutty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you learn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Searched the morgue and found a half tone of him. Positively Karlov. How
      is the patient?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harrison says he's pulling round amazingly. A tough skull. He'll be up
      for his meals in no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do it?&rdquo; she asked with a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manage a place like this? In a busy office district. It's the most
      wonderful apartment in New York. Riverside has nothing like it. It must
      cost like sixty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The building is mine, Kitty. That makes it possible. An uncle who knew I
      hated money and the responsibilities that go with it, died and left it to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Cutty, you must be rich!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry. What can I do? I can't give it away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't have to work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I do. I'm that kind. I'd die of a broken heart if I had to sit
      still. It's the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did mother know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the toe of a snug little bronze boot Kitty drew an outline round a
      pattern in the rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love is a funny thing,&rdquo; was her comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sure is, old-timer. But what put the thought into your head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking how very much mumsy must have been in love with father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she never knew that I loved her, Kitty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that got to do with it? If she had wanted money you wouldn't have
      had the least chance in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not! But what would you have done in your mother's place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snapped you up like that!&rdquo; Kitty flashed back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cheerful little&mdash;little&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liar. Say it!&rdquo; Kitty laughed. &ldquo;But am I a cheerful little liar? I don't
      know. It would be an awful temptation. Somebody to wait on you; heaps of
      flowers when you wanted them; beautiful gowns and thingummies and furs and
      limousines. I've often wondered what I should do if I found myself with
      love and youth on one side and money and attraction on the other. I've
      always been in straitened circumstances. I never spent a dollar in all my
      days when I didn't think I ought to have held back three or four cents of
      it. You can't know, Cutty, what it is to be poor and want beautiful things
      and good times. Of course. I couldn't marry just money. There would have
      to be some kind of a man to go with it. Someone interesting enough to make
      me forget sometimes that I'd thrown away a lover for a pocket-book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you marry me, Kitty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's suppose I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I couldn't marry you, Cutty I should always be having my mother's
      ghost as a rival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But supposing I fell in love with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'd always be doubting your constancy. But what queer talk!&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, you're a joy! Lordy, my luck in dropping in to see you yesterday!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a little whippersnapper like me calling a great man like you Cutty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it embarrasses you, you might switch to papa once in a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's laughter rang down the corridor. &ldquo;I'll remember that whenever I
      want to make you mad. Who's here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody but Harrison and the nurse. Both good citizens, and I've taken
      them into my confidence to a certain extent. You can talk freely before
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to see the patient?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harrison says not. About Wednesday your Two-Hawks will be sitting up.
      I've determined to keep the poor devil here until he can take care of
      himself. But he is flat broke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he had money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Karlov's men stripped him clean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any idea who he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be honest, that's one of the reasons why I want to keep him here. He's
      Russian, for all his Oxford English and his Italian gestures; and from his
      babble I imagine he's been through seven kinds of hell. Torches and
      hobnailed boots and the incessant call for a woman named Olga&mdash;a
      young woman about eighteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you find that out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From a photograph I found in the lining of his coat. A pretty blonde
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo;&mdash;recollecting her dream. &ldquo;Where was it printed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amateur photography. I'll pick it up on the way to the living room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was nothing like the blonde girl of her dream. Still, the girl was
      charming. Kitty turned over the photograph. There was writing on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Russian? What does it say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'To Ivan from Olga with all her love.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty was conscious of the presence of an indefensible malice in his
      tones. Why the deuce should he be bitter&mdash;glad that the chap had left
      behind a sweetheart? He knew exactly the basis of Kitty's interest, as
      utterly detached as that of a reporter going to a fire. On the day the
      patient could explain himself, Kitty's interest would automatically cease.
      An old dog in the manger? Malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cutty, something dreadful has happened to this poor young woman. That's
      what makes him cry out the name. Caught in that horror, and probably he
      alone escaped. Is it heartless to be glad I'm an American? Do they let in
      these Russians?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not since the Trotzky regime. I imagine Two-Hawks slipped through on some
      British passport. He'll probably tell us all about it when he comes round.
      But how do you feel after last night's bout?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alive! And I'm going on being alive, forever and ever! Oh, those awful
      drums! They look like dead eyes in those dim corners. Tumpitum-tump!
      Tumpitum-tump!&rdquo; she cried, linking her arm in his. &ldquo;What a gorgeous view!
      Just what I'm going to do when my ship comes in&mdash;live in a loft. I
      really believe I could write up here&mdash;I mean worth-while things I
      could enjoy writing and sell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's yours if you want it when I leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'd have a fine time explaining to my friends! You old innocent! ...
      Or are you so innocent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do live in a cramped world. But I meant it. Don't forget to whistle
      down to Tony Bernini when you get back home to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the gurgle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I'm tremendously excited. All my life I've wanted to do
      mysterious things. I've been with the audience all the while, and I want
      to be with the actors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll give some man a wild dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I do I'll dance with him. Now lead me to the cookies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was the life of the tea table. Her wit, her effervescence, her
      whimsicalities amused even the prim Miss Frances. When she recounted the
      exploit of the camouflaged fan, Cutty and Harrison laughed so loudly that
      the nurse had to put her finger on her lips. They might wake the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am really interested in him,&rdquo; went on Kitty. &ldquo;I won't deny it. I want
      to see how it's going to turn out. He was very nice after I let him into
      the kitchen. A perfectly English manner and voice, and Italian gestures
      when off his guard. I feel so sorry for him. What strangers we races are
      to each other! Until the war we hardly knew the Canadians. The British
      didn't know us at all, and the French became acquainted with the British
      for the first time in history. And the German thought he knew us all and
      really knew nobody. All the Russians I ever saw were peasants of the
      cattle type; so that the word Russian conjures up two pictures&mdash;the
      grand duke at Monte Carlo and a race of men who wear long beards and never
      bathe except when it rains. Think of it! For the first time since God set
      mankind on earth peoples are becoming acquainted. I never saw a Russian of
      this type before.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A leaf in the whirlpool.&mdash;Anyhow, we'll keep him here until he's on
      his feet. By the way, never answer any telephone call&mdash;I mean, go
      anywhere on a call&mdash;unless you are sure of the speaker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to feel important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are important. You have suddenly become a connecting link between
      this Karlov and the man we wish to protect. I'll confess I wanted you out
      of that apartment at first; but when I saw that you were bent on
      remaining, I decided to make use of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to give me a part in the play?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You are to go about your affairs as always, just as if nothing had
      happened. Only when you wish to come here will you play any game like that
      of to-day. Then it will be advisable. Switch your route each time. Your
      real part is to be that of lure. Through you we shall gradually learn who
      Karlov's associates are. If you don't care to play the role all you have
      to do is to move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea! I'm grateful for anything. You men will never understand. You
      go forth into the world each day&mdash;politics, diplomacy, commerce, war&mdash;while
      we women stay at home and knit or darn socks or take care of the baby or
      make over our clothes and hats or do household work or play the piano or
      read. Never any adventure. Never any games. Never any clubs. The leaving
      your house to go to the office is an adventure. A train from here to
      Philadelphia is an adventure. We women are always craving it. And about
      all we can squeeze out of life is shopping and hiding the bills after
      marriage, and going to the movies before marriage with young men our
      fathers don't like. We can't even stroll the street and admire the
      handsome gowns of our more fortunate sisters the way you men do. When you
      see a pretty woman on the street do you ever stop to think that there are
      ten at home eating their hearts out? Of course you don't. So I'm going
      through with this, to satisfy suppressed instincts; and I shan't promise
      to trot along as usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may attempt to kidnap you, Kitty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn't frighten me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I observe. But if they ever should have the luck to kidnap you, tell
      all you know at once. There's only one way up here&mdash;the elevator. I
      can get out to the fire escape, but none can get in from that direction,
      as the door is of steel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, of course, you'll take me into your confidence completely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the time comes. Half the fun in an adventure is the element of the
      unexpected,&rdquo; said Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you first meet Stefani Gregor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Harrison laughed. He liked this girl. She was keen and could be
      depended upon, as witness last night's work. Her real danger lay in being
      conspicuously pretty, in looking upon this affair as merely a kind of
      exciting game, when it was tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think I know Stefani Gregor?&rdquo; asked Cutty, genuinely
      curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I pronounced that name you whirled upon me as if I had struck you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. When we learn who Two-Hawks is I'll tell you what I know about
      Gregor. And in the meantime you will be ceaselessly under guard. You are
      an asset, Kitty, to whichever side holds you. Captain Harrison is going to
      stay for dinner. Won't you join us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to a studio potluck with some girls. And it's time I was on the
      way. I'll let your Tony Bernini know. Home probably at ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty went with her to the elevator and when he returned to the tea table
      he sat down without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not kidnap her yourself,&rdquo; suggested Harrison, &ldquo;if you don't want her
      in this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would never forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she found it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's the kind who would. What do you think of her, Miss Frances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she is wonderful. Frankly, I should tell her everything&mdash;if
      there is anything more to be told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When dinner was over, the nurse gone back to the patient and Captain
      Harrison to his club, Cutty lit his odoriferous pipe and patrolled the
      windows of his study. Ever since Kitty's departure he had been mulling
      over in his mind a plan regarding her future&mdash;to add a codicil to his
      will, leaving her five thousand a year, so Molly's girl might always have
      a dainty frame for her unusual beauty. The pity of it was that convention
      denied him the pleasure of settling the income upon her at once, while she
      was young. He might outlive her; you never could tell. Anyhow, he would
      see to the codicil. An accident might step in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got out his chrysoprase. In one corner of the room there was a large
      portfolio such as artists use for their proofs and sketches; and from this
      he took a dozen twelve-by-fourteen-inch photographs of beautiful women,
      most of them stage beauties of bygone years. The one on top happened to be
      Patti. The adorable Patti!... Linda, Violetta, Lucia. Lord, what a
      nightingale she had been! He laughed laid the photograph on the desk, and
      dipped his hand into a canvas bag filled with polished green stones which
      would have great commercial value if people knew more about them; for
      nothing else in the world is quite so beautifully green.
    </p>
    <p>
      He built tiaras above the lovely head and laid necklaces across the
      marvellous throat. Suddenly a phenomenon took place. The roguish eyes of
      the prima donna receded and vanished and slate-blue ones replaced them.
      The odd part of it was, he could not dissipate the fancied eyes for the
      replacement of the actual. Patti, with slate-blue eyes! He discarded the
      photograph and selected another. He began the game anew and was just
      beginning the attack on the problem uppermost in his mind when the
      phenomenon occurred again. Kitty's eyes! What infernal nonsense! Kitty had
      served merely to enliven his tender recollections of her mother.
      Twenty-four and fifty-two. And yet, hadn't he just read that Maeterlinck,
      fifty-six, had married Mademoiselle Dahon, many years younger?
    </p>
    <p>
      In a kind of resentful fury he pushed back his chair and fell to pacing,
      eddies and loops and spirals of smoke whirling and sweeping behind him.
      The only light was centred upon the desk, so he might have been some god
      pacing cloud-riven Olympus in the twilight. By and by he laughed; and the
      atmosphere&mdash;mental&mdash;cleared. Maeterlinck, fifty-six, and Cutty,
      fifty-two, were two different men. Cutty might mix his metaphors
      occasionally, but he wasn't going to mix his ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to his singular game. More tiaras and necklaces; and his brain
      took firm hold of the theme which had in the beginning lured him to the
      green stones.

    <p>
      Two-Hawks. That name bothered him. He knew he had heard it before, but
      never in the Russian tongue. It might be that the chap had been spoofing
      Kitty. Still, he had also called himself Hawksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smoke thickened; there were frequent flares of matches. One by one
      Cutty discarded the photographs, dropping them on the floor beside his
      chair, his mind boring this way and that for a solution. He had now come
      to the point where he ceased to see the photographs or the green stones.
      The movements of his hands were almost automatic. And in this abstract
      manner he came to the last photograph. He built a necklace and even
      ventured an earring.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a glorious face&mdash;black eyes that followed you; full lipped;
      every indication of fire and genius. It must be understood that he rarely
      saw the photographs when he played this game. It wasn't an amusing
      pastime, a mental relaxation. It was a unique game of solitaire, the
      photographs and chrysoprase being substituted for cards; and in some
      inexplicable manner it permitted him to concentrate upon whatever problem
      filled his thoughts. It was purely accidental that he saw Patti to-night
      or recalled her art. Coming upon the last photograph without having found
      a solution of the riddle of Two-Hawks he relaxed the mental pressure; and
      his sight reestablished its ability to focus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized the photograph excitedly, scattering the green stones. She! The
      Calabrian, the enchanting colouratura who had vanished from the world at
      the height of her fame, thirty-odd years gone! Two-Hawks!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty saw himself at twenty, in the pit at La Scala, with music-mad Milan
      all about him. Two-Hawks! He remembered now. The nickname the young bloods
      had given her because she had been eternally guarded by her mother and
      aunt, fierce-beaked Calabrians, who had determined that Rosa should never
      throw herself away on some beggarly Adonis.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this chap was her son! Yesterday, rich and powerful, with a name that
      was open sesame wherever he went; to-day, hunted, penniless, and forlorn.
      Cutty sank back in his chair, stunned by the revelation. In that room
      yonder!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a long time Cutty sat perfectly motionless, his pipe at an upward
      angle&mdash;a fine commentary on the strength of his jaws&mdash;and his
      gaze boring into the shadows beyond his desk. What was uppermost in his
      thoughts now was the fateful twist of events that had brought the young
      man to the assured haven of this towering loft.
    </p>
    <p>
      All based, singularly enough, upon his wanting to see Molly's girl for a
      few moments; and thus he had established himself in Kitty's thoughts.
      Instead of turning to the police she had turned to him. Old Cutty,
      reaching round vaguely for something to stay the current&mdash;age; hoping
      by seeing this living link 'twixt the present and the past to stay the
      afterglow of youth. As if that could be done! He, who had never paid any
      attention to gray hairs and wrinkles and time, all at once found himself
      in a position similar to that of the man who supposes he has an
      inexhaustible sum at the bank and has just been notified that he has
      overdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty knew that life wasn't really coordination and premeditation so much
      as it was coincident. Trivials. Nothing was absolute and dependable but
      death; between birth and death a series of accidents and incidents and
      coincidents which men called life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tapped his pipe on the ash tray and stood up. He gathered the
      chrysoprase and restored the stones to the canvas bag. Then he carefully
      stacked the photographs and carried them to the portfolio. The green
      stones he deposited in a safe, from which he took a considerable bundle of
      small notebooks, returning to the desk with these. Denatured dynamite,
      these notebooks, full of political secrets, solutions of mysteries that
      baffle historians. A truly great journalist never writes history as a
      historian; he is afraid to. Sometimes conjecture is safer than fact. And
      these little notebooks were the repository of suppressed facts ranging
      over twenty-odd years. Gerald Stanley Lee would have recognized them
      instantly as coming under the head of what he calls Sh!
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Cutty returned the notebooks to their abiding place, his
      memory refreshed. The poor devil! A dissolute father and uncle, dissolute
      forbears, corrupt blood weakened by intermarriage, what hope was there?
      Only one&mdash;the rich, fiery blood of the Calabrian mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why had the chap come to America? Why not England or the Riviera,
      where rank, even if shorn of its prerogatives, is still treated
      respectfully? But America!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty's head went up. Perhaps that was it&mdash;to barter his phantom
      greatness for money, to dazzle some rich fool of an American girl. In that
      case Karlov would be welcome. But wait a moment. The chap had come in from
      the west. In that event there should be an Odyssey of some kind tucked
      away in the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty resumed his pacing. The moment his imagination caught the essentials
      he visualized the Odyssey. Across mountains and deserts, rivers and seas,
      he followed Two-Hawks in fancy, pursued by an implacable hatred, more or
      less historical, of which the lad was less a cause than an abstract
      object. And Karlov&mdash;Cutty understood Karlov now&mdash;always span
      near, his hate reenergizing his faltering feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was evidently some iron in this Two-Hawks' blood. Fear never would
      have carried him thus far. Fear would have whispered, &ldquo;Futility!
      Futility!&rdquo; And he would have bent his head to the stroke. So then there
      was resource and there was courage. And he lay in yonder room, beaten and
      penniless. The top piece in the grim irony&mdash;to have come all these
      thousands of miles unscathed, to be dropped at the goal. But America?
      Well, that would be solved later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Lord Harry!&rdquo; Cutty stopped and struck his hands together. &ldquo;The
      drums!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the hour Kitty had pronounced the name Stefani Gregor an idea had
      taken lodgment, an irrepressible idea, that somewhere in this drama would
      be the drums of jeopardy. The mark of the thong! Never any doubt of it
      now. Those magnificent emeralds were here in New York, The mob&mdash;the
      Red Guard&mdash;hammering on the doors, what would have been Two-Hawks'
      most natural first thought? To gather what treasures the hand could be
      laid to and flee. Here in New York, and in Karlov's hands, ultimately to
      be cut up for Bolshevik propaganda! The infernal pity of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      The passion of the gem hunter blazed forth, dimming all other phases of
      the drama. Here was a real game, a man's game; sport! Cutty rubbed his
      hands together pleasurably. To recover those green flames before they
      could be broken up; under the ancient ruling that &ldquo;Findings is keepings.&rdquo;
       The stones, of course, meant nothing to Karlov beyond the monetary value;
      and upon this fact Cutty began developing a plan. He stood ready to buy
      those stones if he could draw them into the open. Lord, how he wanted
      them! Murder and loot, always murder and loot!
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of those two incomparable emeralds being broken up distressed
      him profoundly. He must act at once, before the desecration could be
      consummated. Two-Hawks&mdash;Hawksley hereafter, for the sake of
      convenience&mdash;had an equity in the gems; but what of that? In
      smuggling them in&mdash;and how the deuce had he done it?&mdash;he had
      thrown away his legal right to them. Cutty kneaded his conscience into a
      satisfactory condition of quiescence and went on with his planning. If he
      succeeded in recovering the stones and his conscience bit a little too
      deeply for comfort&mdash;why, he could pay over to Hawksley twenty per
      cent. of the price Karlov demanded. He could take it or leave it. In a
      case like this&mdash;to a bachelor without dependents&mdash;money was no
      object. All his life he had wanted a fine emerald to play with, and here
      was an opportunity to acquire two!
    </p>
    <p>
      If this plan failed to draw Karlov into the open, then every jeweller and
      pawnbroker in town would be notified and warned. What with the
      secret-service operatives and the agents of the Department of Justice on
      the watch for Karlov&mdash;who would recognize his limitations of mobility&mdash;it
      was reasonable to assume that the Bolshevik would be only too glad to
      dicker secretly for the disposal of the stones. Now to work. Cutty looked
      at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly midnight. Rather late, but he knew all the tricks of this
      particular kind of game. If the advertisement appeared isolated, all the
      better. The real job would be to hide his identity. He saw a way round
      this difficulty. He wrote out six advertisements, all worded the same. He
      figured out the cost and was delighted to find that he carried the
      necessary currency. Then he got into his engineer's&mdash;dungarees,
      touched up his face and hands to the required griminess, and sallied
      forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luck attended him until he reached the last morning newspaper on the list.
      Here he was obliged to proceed to the city room&mdash;risky business. A
      queer advertisement coming into the city room late at night was always
      pried into, as he knew from experience. Still, he felt that he ought not
      to miss any chance to reach Karlov.
    </p>
    <p>
      He explained his business to the sleepy gate boy, who carried the
      advertisement and the cash to the night city editor's desk. Ordinarily the
      night city editor would have returned the advertisement with the crisp
      information that he had no authority to accept advertisements. But the
      &ldquo;drums of jeopardy&rdquo; caught his attention; and he sent a keen glance across
      the busy room to the rail where Cutty stood, perhaps conspicuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; He called to one of the reporters. &ldquo;This looks like a story. I'll
      run it. Follow that guy in the overalls and see what's in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty appreciated the interlude for what it was worth. Someone was going
      to follow him. When the gate boy returned to notify him that the
      advertisement had been accepted, Cutty went down to the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, there; just a moment!&rdquo; hailed the reporter. &ldquo;I want a word with you
      about that advertisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty came to a standstill. &ldquo;I paid for it, didn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. But what's this about the drums of jeopardy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two great emeralds I'm hunting for,&rdquo; explained Cutty, recalling the man
      who stood on London Bridge and peddled sovereigns at two bits each, and no
      buyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it! Can it!&rdquo; jeered the reporter. &ldquo;Be a good sport and give us the
      tip. Strike call among the city engineers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm telling you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Mike you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. It's the word to tie up the surface lines, like Newark, if you
      want to know. Now, get t' hell out o' here before I hand you one on the
      jaw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporter backed away. &ldquo;Is that on the level?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call up the barns and find out. They'll tell you what's on. And listen,
      if you follow me, I'll break your head. On your way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporter dashed for the elevator&mdash;and back to the doorway in time
      to see Cutty legging it for the Subway. As he was a reporter of the first
      class he managed to catch the same express uptown.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way uptown Cutty considered that he had accomplished a shrewd bit
      of work. Karlov or one of his agents would certainly see that
      advertisement; and even if Karlov suspected a Federal trap he would find
      some means of communicating with the issuer of the advertisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of Kitty returned. What the dickens would she say&mdash;how
      would she act&mdash;when she learned who this Hawksley was? He fervently
      hoped that she had never read &ldquo;Thaddeus of Warsaw.&rdquo; There would be all the
      difference in the world between an elegant refugee Pole and a derelict of
      the Russian autocracy. Perhaps the best course to pursue would be to say
      nothing at all to her about the amazing discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon leaving Elevator Four Cutty said: &ldquo;Bob, I've been followed by a sharp
      reporter. Sheer him off with any tale you please, and go home. Goodnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll fix him, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty took a bath, put on his lounging robe, and tiptoed to the threshold
      of the patient's room. The shaded light revealed the nurse asleep with a
      book on her knees. The patient's eyes were closed and his breathing was
      regular. He was coming along. Cutty decided to go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, when the elevator touched the ground floor, the operator
      observed a prospective passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last trip, sir. You'll have to take the stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where'll I find the engineer who went up with you just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man I took up? Gone to bed, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What floor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing, bo. I'm wise. You're the fourth guy with a subpoena that's
      been after him. Nix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not a lawyer's clerk. I'm a reporter, and I want to ask him a few
      questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee! Has that Jane of his been hauling in the newspapers? Good-night!
      Toddle along, bo; there's nothing coming from me. Nix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would ten dollars make you talk?&rdquo; asked the reporter, desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-ah&mdash;about the Kaiser and his wood-sawing. By-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The operator, secretly enjoying the reporter's discomfiture, shut off the
      lights, slammed the elevator door to the latch, and walked to the
      revolving doors, to the tune of Garry Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter did not follow him but sat down on the first step of the
      marble stairs to think, for there was a lot to think about. He sensed
      clearly enough that all this talk about street-railway strikes and
      subpoenas was rot. The elevator man and the engineer were in cahoots.
      There was a story here, but how to get to it was a puzzler. He had one
      chance in a hundred of landing it&mdash;tip the mail clerk in the business
      office to keep an eye open for the man who called for &ldquo;Double C&rdquo; mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, the man who did call for that mail presented a card to the
      mail clerk. At the bottom of this card was the name of the chief of the
      United States Secret Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And say to the reporter who has probably asked to watch&mdash;hands off!
      Understand? Absolutely&mdash;off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the reporter was informed he blew a kiss into air and sought his city
      editor for his regular assignment. He understood, with the wisdom of his
      calling, that one didn't go whale fishing with trout rods.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early the next morning in a bedroom in a rooming house for aliens in
      Fifteenth Street, a man sat in a chair scanning the want columns of a
      newspaper. Occasionally he jotted down something on a slip of paper. This
      man's job was rather an unusual one. He hunted jobs for other men&mdash;jobs
      in steel mills, great factories, in the textile districts, the street-car
      lines, the shipping yards and docks, any place where there might be a
      grain or two of the powder of unrest and discontent. His business was to
      supply the human matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more parading the streets, no more haranguing from soap boxes. The
      proper place nowadays was in the yard or shop corners at noontime. A word
      or two dropped at the right moment; perhaps a printed pamphlet; little
      wedges wherever there were men who wanted something they neither earned
      nor deserved. Here and there across the land little flares, one running
      into the other, like wildfire on the plains, and then&mdash;the upheaval.
      As in Russia, so now in Germany; later, England and France and here. The
      proletariat was gaining power.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was no fool, this individual. He knew his clay, the day labourer, with
      his parrotlike mentality. Though the victim of this peculiar potter
      absorbs sounds he doesn't often absorb meanings. But he takes these sounds
      and respouts them and convinces himself that he is some kind of Moses,
      headed for the promised land. Inflammable stuff. Hence, the strikes which
      puzzle the average intelligent American citizen. What is it all about?
      Nobody seems to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once upon a time men went on a strike because they were being cheated and
      abused. Now they strike on the principle that it is excellent policy
      always to be demanding something; it keeps capitalism where it belongs&mdash;on
      the ragged edge of things. No matter what they demand they never expect to
      give an equivalent; and a just cause isn't necessary. Thus the present-day
      agitator has only one perplexity&mdash;that of eluding the iron hand of
      the Department of Justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the man in the chair brought the newspaper close up and stared.
      He jumped to his feet, ran out and up the next flight of stairs. He
      stopped before a door and turned the knob a certain number of times.
      Presently the door opened the barest crack; then it was swung wide enough
      to admit the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he whispered, indicating Cutty's advertisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occupant of the room snatched the newspaper and carried it to a
      window.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Will purchase the drums of jeopardy at top price.  No questions
    asked.  Address this office.
                                                          Double C.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. I might have missed it. We shall sell the accursed drums to
      this gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sell them? But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imbecile! What we must do is to find out who this man is. In the end he
      may lead us to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it may be a trap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave that to me. You have work of your own to do, and you had best be
      about it. Do you not see beneath? Who but the man who harbours him would
      know about the drums? The man in the evening clothes. I was too far away
      to see his face. Get me all the morning newspapers. If the advertisement
      is in all of them I will send a letter to each. We lost the young woman
      yesterday. And nothing has been heard of Vladimir and Stemmler. Bad. I do
      not like this place. I move to the house to-night. My old friend Stefani
      may be lonesome. I dare not risk daylight. Some fool may have talked. To
      work! All of us have much to do to wake up the proletariat in this country
      of the blind. But the hour will come. Get me the newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Karlov pushed his visitor from the room and locked and bolted the door. He
      stepped over to the window again and stared down at the clutter of
      pushcarts, drays, trucks, and human beings that tried to go forward and
      got forward only by moving sideways or worming through temporary breaches,
      seldom directly&mdash;the way of humanity. But there was no object lesson
      in this for Karlov, who was not philosophical in the peculiar sense of one
      who was demanding a reason for everything and finding allegory and
      comparison and allusion in the ebb and flow of life. The philosophical is
      often misapplied to the stoical. Karlov was a stoic, not a philosopher, or
      he would not have been the victim of his present obsession. The idea of
      live and let live has never been the propaganda of the anarch. To the
      anarch the death of some body or the destruction of some thing is the
      cornerstone to his madhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing would ever cure this man of his obsession&mdash;the death of
      Hawksley and the possession of the emeralds. Moreover, there was the
      fanatical belief in his poor disordered brain that the accomplishment of
      these two projects would eventually assist in the liberation of mankind.
      Abnormally cunning in his methods of approach, he lacked those imaginative
      scales by which we weigh our projects and which we call logic. A child
      alone in a house with a box of matches; a dog on one side of Fifth Avenue
      that sees a dog on the other side, but not the automobiles&mdash;inexorable
      logic&mdash;irresistible force&mdash;whizzing up and down the middle of
      that thoroughfare. It is not difficult to prophesy what is going to happen
      to that child, that dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karlov was at this moment reaching out toward a satisfactory solution
      relative to the disappearance of the gems. They had not been found on his
      enemy; they had not been found in the Gregor apartment; the two men
      assigned to the task of securing them would not have risked certain death
      by trying to do a little bargaining on their own initiative. In the first
      instance they had come forth empty-handed. In the second instance&mdash;that
      of intimidating the girl to disclose his whereabouts&mdash;neither
      Vladimir nor Stemmler had returned. Sinister. The man in the dress suit
      again?
    </p>
    <p>
      Conceivably, then, the drums were in the possession of this girl; and she
      was holding them against the day when the fugitive would reclaim them. The
      advertisement was a snare. Very good. Two could play that game as well as
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl. Was it not always so? That breed! God's curse on them all! A
      crooked finger, and the women followed, hypnotized. The girl was away from
      the apartment the major part of the day; so it was in order to search her
      rooms. A pretty little fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where were they hiding him? Gall and wormwood! That he should slip
      through Boris Karlov's fingers, after all these tortuous windings across
      the world! Patience. Sooner or later the girl would lead the way. Still,
      patience was a galling hobble when he had so little time, when even now
      they might be hunting him. Boris Karlov had left New York rather well
      known.
    </p>
    <p>
      He expanded under this thought. For the spiritual breath of life to the
      anarch is flattery, attention. Had the newspapers ignored Trotzky's advent
      into Russia, had they omitted the daily chronicle of his activities, the
      Russian problem would not be so large as it is this day. Trotzky would
      have died of chagrin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would answer this advertisement. Trap? He would set one himself. The
      man who eventually came to negotiate would be made a prisoner and forced
      to disclose the identity of the man who had interfered with the great
      projects of Boris Karlov, plenipotentiary extraordinary for the red
      government of Russia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midtown, Cutty tapped his breakfast egg dubiously. Not that he speculated
      upon the freshness of the egg. What troubled him was that advertisement.
      Last night, keyed high by his remarkable discovery of the identity of his
      guest and his cupidity relative to the emeralds, he had laid himself open.
      If he knew anything at all about the craft, that reporter would be digging
      in. Fortunately he had resources unsuspected by the reporter. Legitimately
      he could send a secret-service operative to collect the mail&mdash;if
      Karlov decided to negotiate. Still within his rights, he could use another
      operative to conduct the negotiations. If in the end Karlov strayed into
      the net the use of the service for private ends would be justified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord, those green stones! Well, why not? Something in the world worth a
      hazard. What had he in life but this second grand passion? There shot into
      his mind obliquely an irrelevant question. Supposing, in the old days, he
      had proceeded to reach for Molly as he was now reaching for the emeralds&mdash;a
      bit lawlessly? After all these years, to have such a thought strike him!
      Hadn't he stepped aside meekly for Conover? Hadn't he observed and envied
      Conover's dazzling assault? Supposing Molly had been wavering, and this
      method of attack had decided her? Never to have thought of that before!
      What did a woman want? A love storm, and then an endless after-calm. And
      it had taken him twenty-odd years to make this discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fact. He had never been shy of women. He had somehow preferred to play
      comrade instead of gallant; and all the women had taken advantage of that,
      used him callously to pair with old maids, faded wives, and homely
      debutantes.
    </p>
    <p>
      What impellent was driving him toward these introspections? Kitty, Molly's
      girl. Each time he saw her or thought of her&mdash;the uninvited ghost of
      her mother. Any other man upon seeing Kitty or thinking about her would
      have jumped into the future from the spring of a dream. The disparity in
      years would not have mattered. It was all nonsense, of course. But for his
      dropping into the office and casually picking up the thread of his
      acquaintance with Kitty, Molly&mdash;the memory of her&mdash;would have
      gone on dimming. Actions, tremendous and world-wide, had set his vision
      toward the future; he had been too busy to waste time in retrospection and
      introspection. Thus, instead of a gently rising and falling tide,
      healthily recurrent, a flood of mixed longings that was swirling him into
      uncertain depths. Those emeralds had bobbed up just in time. The chase
      would serve to pull him out of this bog.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard a footstep and looked up. The nurse was beckoning to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's awake, and there is sanity in his eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great! Has he talked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The awakening happened just this moment, and I came to you. You never
      can tell about blows on the skull or brain fever&mdash;never any two eases
      alike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty threw down his napkin and accompanied the nurse to the bedside. The
      glance of the patient trailed from Cutty to the nurse and back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk,&rdquo; said Cutty. &ldquo;Don't ask any questions. Take it easy until
      later in the day. You are in the hands of persons who wish you well. Eat
      what the nurse gives you. When the right time comes we'll tell you all
      about ourselves, You've been robbed and beaten. But the men who did it are
      under arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One question,&rdquo; said the patient, weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, just one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A girl&mdash;who gave me something to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She fed you, and later probably your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Hawksley closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty and the nurse watched him interestedly for a few minutes; but as he
      did not stir again the nurse took up her temperature sheet and Cutty
      returned to his eggs. Was there a girl? No question about the emeralds, no
      interest in the day and the hour. Was there a girl? The last person he had
      seen, Kitty; the first question, after coming into the light: Had he seen
      her? Then and there Cutty knew that when he died he would carry into the
      Beyond, of all his earthly possessions&mdash;a chuckle. Human beings!
    </p>
    <p>
      The yarn that reporter had missed by a hair&mdash;front page, eight-column
      head! But he had missed it, and that was the main thing. The poor devil!
      Beaten and without a sou marque in his pockets, his trail was likely to be
      crowded without the assistance of any newspaper publicity. But what a
      yarn! What a whale of a yarn!
    </p>
    <p>
      In his fevered flights Hawksley had spoken of having paid Kitty for that
      meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty had said nothing about it. Supposing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telephone, sair,&rdquo; announced the Jap. &ldquo;Lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Molly's girl! Cutty sprinted to the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! That you, Kitty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. How is Johnny Two-Hawks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When can I see him? I'm just crazy to know what the story is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say the third or fourth day from this. We'll have him shaved and sitting
      up then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he talked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not permitted. Still determined to stay the run of your lease?&rdquo; Cutty
      heard a laugh. &ldquo;All right. Only I hope you will never have cause to regret
      this decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddlesticks! All I've got to do in danger is to press a button, and
      presto! here's Bernini.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, did Hawksley pay you for that meal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens, no! What makes you ask that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his delirium he spoke of having paid you. I didn't know.&rdquo; Cutty's
      heart began to rap against his ribs. Supposing, after all, Karlov hadn't
      the stones? Supposing Hawksley had hidden them somewhere in Kitty's
      kitchen?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything about Gregor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Remember, you're to call me up twice a day and report the news. Don't
      go out nights if you can avoid it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be good,&rdquo; Kitty agreed. &ldquo;And now I must hie me to the job. Imagine,
      Cutty!&mdash;writing personalities about stage folks and gabfesting with
      Burlingame and all the while my brain boiling with this affair! The city
      room will kill me, Cutty, if it ever finds out that I held back such a
      yarn. But it wouldn't be fair to Johnny Two-Hawks. Cutty, did you know
      that your wonderful drums of jeopardy are here in New York?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; barked Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody is offering to buy them. There was an advertisement in the paper
      this morning. Cutty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first problem in arithmetic is two and two make four. By-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dizzily Cutty hung up the receiver. He had not reckoned on the possibility
      of Kitty seeing that damfool advertisement. Two and two made four; and
      four and four made eight; so on indefinitely. That is to say, Kitty
      already had a glimmer of the startling truth. The initial misstep on his
      part had been made upon her pronouncement of the name Stefani Gregor. He
      hadn't been able to control his surprise. And yesterday, having frankly
      admitted that he knew Gregor, all that was needed to complete the circle
      was that advertisement. Cutty tore his hair, literally. The very door he
      hoped she might overlook he had thrown open to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thaddeus of Warsaw. But it should not be. He would continue to offer a
      haven to that chap; but no nonsense. None of that sinister and unfortunate
      blood should meddle with Kitty Conover's happiness. Her self-appointed
      guardian would attend to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized that his attitude was rather inexplicable; but there were some
      adventures which hypnotized women; and one of this sort was now unfolding
      for Kitty. That she had her share of common sense was negligible in face
      of the facts that she was imaginative and romantical and adventuresome,
      and that for the first time she was riding one of the great middle
      currents in human events. She was Molly's girl; Cutty was going to look
      out for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mighty odd that this fear for her should have sprung into being that
      night, quite illogically. Prescience? He could not say. Perhaps it was a
      borrowed instinct&mdash;fatherly; the same instinct that would have
      stirred her father into action&mdash;the protection of that dearest to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he told her who Hawksley really was, that would intrigue her. If he
      made a mystery of the affair, that, too, would intrigue her. And there you
      were, 'twixt the devil and the deep blue sea. Hang it, what evil luck had
      stirred him to tell her about those emeralds? Already she was building a
      story to satisfy her dramatic fancy. Two and two made four&mdash;which
      signified that she was her father's daughter, that she would not rest
      until she had explored every corner of this dark room. Wanting to keep her
      out of it, and then dragging her into it through his cupidity. Devil take
      those emeralds! Always the same; trouble wherever they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real danger would rise during the convalescence. Kitty would be
      contriving to drop in frequently; not to see Hawksley especially, but her
      initial success in playing hide and seek with secret agents, friendly and
      otherwise, had tickled her fancy. For a while it would be an exciting
      game; then it might become only a means to an end. Well, it should not be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there a girl! Already Hawksley had recorded her beauty. Very well; the
      first sign of sentimental nonsense, and out he should go, Karlov or no
      Karlov. Kitty wasn't going to know any hurt in this affair. That much was
      decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty stormed into his study, growling audibly. He filled a pipe and
      smoked savagely. Another side, Kitty's entrance into the drama promised to
      spoil his own fun; he would have to play two games instead of one. A fine
      muddle!
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to a stand before one of the windows and saw the glory of the
      morning flashing from the myriad spires and towers and roofs, and wondered
      why artists bothered about cows in pastures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Touching his knees was an antique Florentine bridal chest, with exquisite
      carving and massive lock. He threw back the lid and disclosed a miscellany
      never seen by any eye save his own. It was all the garret he had. He dug
      into it and at length resurrected the photograph of a woman whose face was
      both roguish and beautiful. He sat on the floor a la Turk and studied the
      face, his own tender and wistful. No resemblance to Kitty except in the
      eyes. How often he had gone to her with the question burning his lips,
      only to carry it away unspoken! He turned over the photograph and read:
      &ldquo;To the nicest man I know. With love from Molly.&rdquo; With love. And he had
      stepped aside for Tommy Conover!
    </p>
    <p>
      By George! He dropped the photograph into the chest, let down the lid, and
      rose to his feet. Not a bad idea, that. To intrigue Kitty himself, to
      smother her with attentions and gallantries, to give her out of his wide
      experience, and to play the game until this intruder was on his way
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could do it; and he based his assurance upon his experiences and
      observations. Never a squire of dames, he knew the part. He had played the
      game occasionally in the capitals of Europe when there had been some
      information he had particularly desired. Clever, scheming women, too. A
      clever, passably good-looking elderly man could make himself peculiarly
      attractive to young women and women in the thirties. Dazzlement for the
      young; the man who knew all about life, the trivial little courtesies a
      younger man generally forgot; the moving of chairs, the holding of wraps;
      the gray hairs which served to invite trust and confidence, which lulled
      the eternal feminine fear of the male. To the older women, no callow youth
      but a man of discernment, discretion, wit and fancy and daring, who
      remembered birthdays husbands forgot, who was always round when wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no vanity back of these premises. Cutty was merely reaching
      about for an expedient to thwart what to his anticipatory mind promised to
      be an inevitability. Of course the glamour would not last; it never did,
      but he felt he could sustain it until yonder chap was off and away.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening at five-thirty Kitty received a box of beautiful roses, with
      Cutty's card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the lovely things!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed them and set them in a big copper jug, arranged and rearranged
      them for the simple pleasure it afforded her. What a dear man this Cutty
      was, to have thought of her in this fashion! Her father's friend, her
      mother's, and now hers; she had inherited him. This thought caused her to
      smile, but there were tears in her eyes. A garden some day to play in,
      this mad city far away, a home of her own; would it ever happen?
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell rang. She wasn't going to like this caller for taking her away
      from these roses, the first she had received in a long time&mdash;roses
      she could keep and not toss out the window. For it must not be understood
      that Kitty was never besieged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside stood a well-dressed gentleman, older than Cutty, with shrewd,
      inquiring gray eyes and a face with strong salients.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, but I am looking for a man by the name of Stephen Gregory. I
      was referred by the janitor to you. You are Miss Conover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Kitty. &ldquo;Will you come in?&rdquo; She ushered the stranger into
      the living room and indicated a chair. &ldquo;Please excuse me for a moment.&rdquo;
       Kitty went into her bedroom and touched the danger button, which would
      summon Bernini. She wanted her watchdog to see the visitor. She returned
      to the living room. &ldquo;What is it you wish to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where I may find this Gregory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That nobody seems able to answer. He was carried away from here in an
      ambulance; but we have been unable to locate the hospital. If you will
      leave your name&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not necessary. I am out of bounds, you might say, and I'd rather
      my name should be left out of the affair, which is rather peculiar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only an agent, and am not at liberty to speak. Could you describe
      Gregory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he is a stranger to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty described Gregor deliberately and at length. It struck her that the
      visitor was becoming bored, though he nodded at times. She was glad to
      hear Bernini's ring. She excused herself to admit the Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A false alarm,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Someone inquiring for Gregor. I thought
      it might be well for you to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll work the radiator stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernini went into the living room and fussed over the steam cock of the
      radiator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing the matter with it, miss. Just stuck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to have troubled you,&rdquo; said the stranger, rising and picking up his
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernini went down to the basement, obfuscated; for he knew the visitor. He
      was one of the greatest bankers in New York&mdash;that is to say, in
      America! Asking questions about Stefani Gregor!

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      About nine o'clock that same night a certain rich man, having established
      himself comfortably under the reading lamp, a fine book in his hands and a
      fine after-dinner cigar between his teeth, was exceedingly resentful when
      his butler knocked, entered, and presented a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My orders were that I was not at home to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. But he said you would see him because he came to see you
      regarding a Mr. Gregory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn these newspapers!... Wait, wait!&rdquo; the banker called, for the butler
      was starting for the door to carry the anathema to the appointed head.
      &ldquo;Bring him in. He's a big bug, and I can't afford to affront him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&rdquo;&mdash;with the colourless tone of a perfect servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the visitor entered he stopped just beyond the threshold. He remained
      there even after the butler closed the door. Blue eye and gray clashed;
      two masters of fence who had executed the same stroke. The banker laughed
      and Cutty smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said the banker, &ldquo;you and I ought to sign an armistice, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you've always been rather a puzzle to me. A rich man, a gentleman,
      and yet sticking to the newspaper game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you're a puzzle to me, too. A rich man, a gentleman, and yet sticking
      to the banking game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil was our row about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't quite recall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever it was it was the way you went at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A reform was never yet accomplished by purring and pussyfooting,&rdquo; said
      Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come over and sit down. Now, how the devil did you find out about this
      Gregory affair?&rdquo; The banker held out his hand, which Cutty grasped with
      honest pressure. &ldquo;If you are here in the capacity of a newspaper man, not
      a word out of me. Have a cigar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never smoke anything but pipes that ruin curtains. You should have
      given your name to Miss Conover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was under promise not to explain my business. But before we proceed, an
      answer. Newspaper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I represent the Department of Justice. And we'll get along easier
      when I add that I possess rather unlimited powers under that head. How did
      you happen to stumble into this affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through Captain Rathbone, my prospective son-in-law, who is in Coblenz. A
      cable arrived this morning, instructing me to proceed precisely in the
      manner I did. Rathbone is an intimate friend of the man I was actually
      seeking. The apartment of this man Gregory was mentioned to Rathbone in a
      cable as a possible temporary abiding place. What do you want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether or not he is undesirable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly, I should say, desirable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make that statement as an American citizen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. I make it unreservedly because my future son-in-law is rather a
      difficult man to make friends with. I am acting merely as Rathbone's
      agent. On the other hand, I should be a cheerful liar if I told you I
      wasn't interested. What do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; answered Cutty, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know where this young man is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this moment he is in my apartment, rather seriously battered and
      absolutely penniless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be tinker-dammed! You know who he is, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And I want all your information so that I may guide my future
      actions accordingly. If he is really undesirable he shall be deported the
      moment he can stand on his two feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The banker pyramided his fingers, rather pleased to learn that he could
      astonish this interesting beggar. &ldquo;He has on account at my bank half a
      million dollars. Originally he had eight hundred thousand. The three
      hundred thousand, under cable orders from Yokohama, was transferred to our
      branch in San Francisco. This was withdrawn about two weeks ago. How does
      that strike you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All in a heap,&rdquo; confessed Cutty. &ldquo;When was this fund established with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shortly before Kerensky's government blew up. The funds were in our
      London bank. There was, of course, a lot of red tape, excessive charges in
      exchange, and all that. Anyhow, about eight hundred thousand arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brought him to America? Why didn't he go to England? That would have
      been the safest haven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can explain that. He intends to become an American citizen. Some time
      ago he became the owner of a fine cattle ranch in Montana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be tinker-dammed, too!&rdquo; exploded Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young man with these ideas in his head ought eventually to become a
      first-rate citizen. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am considerably relieved. His forbears, the blood&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His mother was a healthy Italian peasant&mdash;a famous singer in her
      time. His fortune, I take it, was his inheritance from her. She made a
      fortune singing in the capitals of Europe and speculating from time to
      time. She sent the boy, at the age of ten, to England. Afraid of the home
      influence. He remained there, under the name of Hawksley, for something
      like fourteen years, under the guardianship of this fellow Gregory. Of
      Gregory I know positively nothing. The young fellow is, to all purposes,
      methods of living, points of view, an Englishman. Rathbone, who was
      educated at Oxford, met him there and they shared quarters. But it was
      only in recent years that he learned the identity of his friend. In 1914
      the young fellow returned to Russia. Military obligations. That's all I
      know. Mighty interesting, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much obliged to you. The white elephant becomes a normal drab
      pachyderm,&rdquo; said Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still something of an elephant on your hands. I see. Bring him here if
      you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sic the Bolshevik at your door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so. You spoke of his having been beaten and robbed. Bolshevik?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. An old line of reasoning first put into effect by Oliver Cromwell.
      The axe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fact. I'm sorry for him, but I wish he would blow away conveniently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rathbone says he's handsome, gay, but decent, considering. Humanity is
      being knocked about some. The hour has come for our lawyers to go back to
      their offices. Politics must step aside for business. We ought to hang up
      signs in every state capitol in the country: 'Men Wanted&mdash;Specialists.'
      A steel man from Pittsburgh, a mining man from Idaho, a shipowner from
      Boston, a meat packer from Omaha, a grain man from Chicago. What the devil
      do lawyers know about these things&mdash;the energies that make the wheels
      of this country go round? By the way, that Miss Conover was a remarkably
      pretty girl. She seemed to be a bit suspicious of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good reasons. That chap went to Gregor's&mdash;Gregor is his name&mdash;and
      was beaten, robbed, and left for dead. She saved his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord! Does she know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. And what's more, I don't want her to. I am practically her guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you ought to get her out of that roost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it, I can't get her to leave. I'm not legally her guardian;
      self-appointed. But she has agreed to leave in May.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you dropped in. Command me in any way you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's very good of you, considering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The war is over. We'd be a fine pair of fools to let an ancient grudge go
      on. They tell me you've a wonderful apartment on top of that skyscraper of
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come to dinner some night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any time you say. I should like to bring my daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Heard of Hawksley; thinks he's English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certainly agreeable.&rdquo; This would be a distinct advantage to Kitty.
      &ldquo;I see you have a good book there. I'll take myself off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the Avenue Cutty loaded his pipe. He struck a match on the flagstone
      and cupped it over the bowl of his pipe, thereby throwing his picturesque
      countenance into ruddy relief. Opposite emotions filled the hearts of the
      two men watching him&mdash;in one, chagrin; in the other, exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty decided to walk downtown, the night being fine. He set his foot to a
      long, swinging stride. An elephant on his hands, truly. Poor devil, for a
      fad! Nobody wanted him, not even those who wished him well. Wanted to
      become an American citizen. He would have been tolerably safe in England.
      Here he would never be free of danger. A ranch. The beggar would have a
      chance out there in the West. The anarchist and the Bolshevik were town
      cooties. His one chance, actually. The poor devil! Kitty had the right
      idea. It was a mighty fine thing, these times, to be a citizen under the
      protection of the American doctrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hundred thousand! And Karlov had got that along with the drums. The
      devil's own for luck! The fool would be able to start some fine ructions
      with all that capital behind him. Episodes in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty dreamed of wonderful rose gardens, endless and changing; but strive
      as she would she could not find Cutty anywhere, which worried her, even in
      her dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse heard the patient utter a single word several times before he
      fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fan!&rdquo; And he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hunted for the palm leaf, but with a slight gesture he signified that
      that was not what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty played solitaire with his chrysoprase until the telephone broke in
      upon his reveries. What he heard over the wire disturbed him greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were followed from the Avenue to the apartment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Henderson. You assigned me to watch the apartment in Eightieth
      through the night. I followed the man who followed you. He saw your face
      when you lit the pipe. When the banker left Miss Conover he was followed
      home. That established him in the affair. The follower hung round, and so
      did I. You appeared. He took a chance shot in the dark. Not sure, but
      doing a bit of clever guessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You still followed him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did he wind up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A house in the warehouse district. Vacant warehouses on each side. Some
      new nest. I can lead you to it, sir, any time you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty pushed aside the telephone and returned to his green stones. After
      all, why worry? It was unfortunate, of course, but the apartment was more
      inaccessible than the top of the Matterhorn. Still, they might discover
      what his real business was and interfere seriously with his future work on
      the other side. A ruin in the warehouse district? A good place to look for
      Stefani Gregor&mdash;if he were still alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was. And in his dark room he cried piteously for water&mdash;water&mdash;water!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      A March day, sunny and cloudless, with fresh, bracing winds. Green things
      pushed up from the soil; an eternal something was happening to the tips of
      the tree branches; an eternal something was happening in young hearts. A
      robin shook the dust of travel from his wings and bathed publicly in a
      park basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there under the ten thousand roofs of the great city poets were
      busy with inkpots, trying to say an old thing in a new way. Woe to the
      pinched soul that did not expand this day, for it was spring. Expansion!
      Nature&mdash;perhaps she was relenting a little, perhaps she saw that
      humanity was sliding down the scale, withering, and a bit of extra
      sunshine would serve to check the descension and breed a little optimism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty's study. The sunlight, thrown westward, turned windows and roofs and
      towers into incomparable bijoux. The double reflection cast a white light
      into the room, lifting out the blue and old-rose tints of the Ispahan rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty shifted the chrysoprase, irresolutely for him. A dozen problems, and
      it was mighty hard to decide which to tackle first. Principally there was
      Kitty. He had not seen her in four days, deeming it advisable for her not
      to call for the present. The Bolshevik agent who had followed him from the
      banker's might decide, without the aid of some connecting episode, that he
      had wasted his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not matter that Kitty herself was no longer watched and followed
      from her home to the office, from the office home. Was Karlov afraid or
      had he some new trick up his sleeve? It was not possible that he had given
      up Hawksley. He was probably planning an attack from some unexpected
      angle. To be sure that Karlov would not find reason to associate him with
      Kitty, Cutty had remained indoors during the daytime and gone forth at
      night in his dungarees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Problem Two was quite as formidable. The secret agent who had passed as a
      negotiator for the drums of jeopardy had disappeared. That had sinister
      significance. Karlov did not intend to sell the drums; merely wanted
      precise information regarding the man who had advertised for them. If the
      secret-service man weakened under torture, Cutty recognized that his own
      usefulness would be at an end. He would have to step aside and let the
      great currents sweep on without him. In that event these fifty-two years
      would pile upon his head, full measure; for the only thing that kept him
      vigorous was action, interest. Without some great incentive he would
      shrivel up and blow away&mdash;like some exhumed mummy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Problem Three. How the deuce was he going to fascinate Kitty if he
      couldn't see her? But there was a bit of silver lining here. If he
      couldn't see her, what chance had Hawksley? The whole sense and prompting
      of this problem was to keep Kitty and Hawksley apart. How this was
      accomplished was of no vital importance. Problem Three, then, hung fire
      for the present. Funny, how this idea stuck in his head, that Hawksley was
      a menace to Kitty. One of those fool ideas, probably, but worth trying
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Problem Four. That night, all on his own, he would make an attempt to
      enter that old house sandwiched between the two vacant warehouses. Through
      pressure of authority he had obtained keys to both warehouses. There would
      be a trap on the roof of that house. Doubtless it would be covered with
      tin; fairly impregnable if latched below. But he could find out. From the
      third-floor windows of either warehouse the drop was not more than six
      feet. If anywhere in town poor old Stefani Gregor would be in one of those
      rooms. But to storm the house frontally, without being absolutely sure,
      would be folly. Gregor would be killed. The house was in fact an insane
      asylum, occupied by super-insane men. Warned, they were capable of blowing
      the house to kingdom come, themselves with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Problem Five was a mere vanishing point. He doubted if he would ever see
      those emeralds. What an infernal pity!
    </p>
    <p>
      He built a coronet and leaned back, a wisp of smoke darting up from the
      bowl of his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, you know, but that's a ripping game to play!&rdquo; drawled a tired
      voice over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty turned his head, to behold Hawksley, shaven, pale, and handsome,
      wrapped in a bed quilt and swaying slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce are you doing out of your room?&rdquo; growled Cutty, but with
      the growl of a friendly dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley dropped into a chair weakly. &ldquo;End of my rope. Got to talk to
      someone. Go dotty, else. Questions. Skull aches with 'em. Want to know
      whether this is a foretaste of the life I have a right to live&mdash;or
      the beginning of death. Be a good sport, and let's have it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you wish to know?&rdquo; asked Cutty, gently. The poor beggar!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where I am. Who you are. What happened to me. What is going to happen to
      me,&rdquo; rather breathlessly. &ldquo;Don't want any more suspense. Don't want to
      look over my shoulder any more. Straight ahead. All the cards on the
      table, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty rose and pushed the invalid's chair to a window and drew another up
      beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, the top of the world! Bally odd roost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find it safer here than you would on the shores of Kaspuskoi
      More,&rdquo; replied Cutty, gravely. &ldquo;The Caspian wouldn't be a healthy place
      for you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With wide eyes Hawksley stared across the shining, wavering roofs. A
      pause. &ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo; he asked, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything. But wait!&rdquo; Cutty fetched one of the photographs and laid it
      upon the young man's knees. &ldquo;Know who this is&mdash;Two-Hawks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strained, tense gesture as Hawksley seized the photograph; then his chin
      sank slowly to his chest. A moment later Cutty was profoundly astonished
      to see something sparkle on its way down the bed quilt. Tears!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry!&rdquo; cried Cutty, troubled and embarrassed. &ldquo;I'm terribly sorry! I
      should have had the decency to wait a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, thank you!&rdquo; Hawksley flung up his head. &ldquo;Nothing in all
      God's muddied world could be more timely&mdash;the face of my mother! I am
      not ashamed of these tears. I am not afraid to die. I am not even afraid
      to live. But all the things I loved&mdash;the familiar earth, the human
      beings, my dog&mdash;gone. I am alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; repeated Cutty, a bit choked up. This was honest misery and
      it affected him deeply. He felt himself singularly drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to live. Because I am young? No. I want to prove to the shades of
      those who loved me that I am fit to go on. So my identity is known to
      you?&rdquo;&mdash;dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You wish me to forget what I know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you?&rdquo;&mdash;eagerly. &ldquo;Will you forget that I am anything but a
      naked, friendless human being?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But your enemies know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather fancy they will keep the truth to themselves. Let them publish
      my identity, and a hundred havens would be offered. Your Government would
      protect me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is doing so now, indirectly. But why do you not want it known?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freedom! Would I have it if known? Could I trust anybody? Would it not be
      essentially the old life in a new land? I want a new life in a new land. I
      want to be born again. I want to be what you patently are, an American.
      That is why I risked life a hundred times in coming all these miles, why I
      sit in this chair before you, with the room rocking because they battered
      in my head. I do not offer a human wreck, an illiterate mind, in exchange
      for citizenship. I bring a tolerably decent manhood. Try me! Always I have
      admired you people. Always we Russians have. But there is no Russia now
      that I can ever return to!&rdquo; Hawksley's head drooped again and his
      bloodshot eyes closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty sensed confusion, indecision; all his deductions were upset in the
      face of this strange appeal. Russian, born of an Italian mother and
      speaking Oxford English as if it were his birthright; and wanting
      citizenship! Wasn't ashamed of his tears; wasn't afraid to die or to live!
      Cutty searched quickly for a new handhold to his antagonism, but he found
      only straws. He was honest enough to realize that he had built this
      antagonism upon a want, a desire; there was no foundation for it.
      Downright likeable. A chap who had gone through so much, who was in such a
      pitiable condition, would not have the wit to manufacture character,
      camouflage his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it!&rdquo; he said, briskly. &ldquo;You shall have your chance. Talk like that
      will carry a man anywhere in this country. You shall stay here until you
      are strong again. Then some night I'll put you on your train for Montana.
      You want to ask questions. I'll save you the trouble by telling you what I
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his narrative contained no mention of the emeralds. Why? A bit
      conscience-stricken because, if he could, he was going to rob his guest on
      the basis that findings is keepings? Cutty wasn't ready to analyze the
      omission. Perhaps he wanted Hawksley himself to inquire about the stones;
      test him out. If he asked frankly that would signify that he had brought
      the stones in honestly, paid his obligations to the Customs. Otherwise,
      smuggling; and in that event conscience wouldn't matter; the emeralds
      became a game anybody could take a hand in&mdash;anybody who considered
      the United States Customs an infringement upon human rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a devil of a call those stones had for him! Did they mean anything to
      Hawksley aside from their intrinsic value? But for the nebulous idea,
      originally, that the emeralds were mixed up somewhere in this adventure,
      Cutty knew that he would have sent Hawksley to a hospital, left him to his
      fate, and never known who he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the narration Hawksley listened motionless, with his eyes
      closed, possibly to keep the wavering instability of the walls from
      interfering with his assimilation of this astonishing series of fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Found you insensible on the floor,&rdquo; concluded Cutty, &ldquo;hoisted you to my
      shoulders, took you to the street&mdash;and here you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley opened his eyes. &ldquo;I say, you know, what a devil of an old
      Sherlock you must be! And you carried me on your shoulders across that
      fire escape? Ripping! When I stepped back into that room I heard a rushing
      sound. I knew! But I didn't have the least chance.... You and that bully
      girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty swore under his breath. He had taken particular pains to avoid
      mentioning Kitty; and here, first off, the fat was in the fire. He
      remembered now that he had told Hawksley that Kitty had saved his life.
      Fortunately, the chap wasn't keen enough with that banged-up head of his
      to apply reason to the omission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saved my life. Suppose she doesn't want me to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty jumped at this. &ldquo;Doesn't care to be mixed up with the Bolshevik end
      of it. Besides, she doesn't know who you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fewer that know the better. But I'll always remember her kindness and
      that bally pistol with the fan in it. But you? Why did you bother to bring
      me up here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't decently leave you where Karlov could get to you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Stefani Gregor dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know; probably not. But we are hunting for him.&rdquo; Cutty had not
      explained his interest in Gregor. Those plaguey stones again. They were
      demoralizing him. Loot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke of Karlov. Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the man who followed you across half the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were many. What is he like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gorilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Hawksley became galvanized and extended his fists. &ldquo;God let me live
      long enough to put my hands on him! I had the chance the other day&mdash;to
      blot out his face with my boots! But I couldn't do it! I couldn't do it!&rdquo;
       He sagged in the chair. &ldquo;No, no! Just a bit groggy. All right in a
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Lord Harry, I'll see you through. Now buck up. Hear that?&rdquo; cried
      Cutty, throwing up a window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look through that street there. See the glint of bayonets? American
      soldiers, marching up Fifth Avenue, thousands of them, freemen who broke
      the vaunted Hindenburg Line. God bless 'em! Americans, every mother's son
      of 'em; who went away laughing, who returned laughing, who will go back to
      their jobs laughing. The ability to laugh, that's America. Do you know how
      to laugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to. I'm jolly weak just now. But I'll grin if you want me to.&rdquo; And
      Hawksley grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way. A grin in this country will take you quite as far. All
      right. In five years you'll be voting. I'll see to that. Now back to bed
      with you, and no more leaving it until the nurse says so. What you need is
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty sent a call to the nurse, who was standing undecidedly in the
      doorway; and together they put the derelict back to bed. Then Cutty
      fetched the photograph and set it on top of the dresser, where Hawksley
      could see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, no more gallivanting about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise, old top. This bed is a little bit of all right. I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long am I to be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're good, two weeks,&rdquo; interposed the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two weeks? I say, would you mind doing me a trifling favour? I'd like a
      violin to amuse myself with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fiddle? I don't know a thing about 'em except that they sound good.&rdquo;
       Cutty pulled at his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever it costs I'll reimburse you the day I'm up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I'll bring you a bundle of them, and you can do your own
      selecting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out in the corridor the nurse said: &ldquo;I couldn't hold him. But he'll be
      easier now that he's got the questions off his mind. He will have to be
      humoured a lot. That's one of the characteristics of head wounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to be gentle and patient; and I imagine he's hard to resist when
      he wants anything. Winning, you'd call it. I suppose I mustn't ask who he
      really is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Poor devil. The fewer that know, the better. I'll be home round
      three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once in the street, Cutty was besieged suddenly with the irresistible
      desire to mingle with the crowd over in the Avenue, to hear the military
      bands, the shouts, to witness the gamut of emotions which he knew would
      attend this epochal day. Of course he would view it all from the aloof
      vantage of the historian, and store away commentaries against future
      needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what a crowd it was! He was elbowed and pushed, jostled and trod on,
      carried into the surges, relegated to the eddies; and always the metallic
      taptap of steel-shod boots on the asphalt, the bayonets throwing back the
      radiant sunshine in sharp, clear flashes. The keen, joyous faces of those
      boys. God, to be young like that! To have come through that hell on earth
      with the ability still to smile! Cutty felt the tears running down his
      cheeks. Instinctively he knew that this was to be his last thrill of this
      order. He was fifty-two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit your crowding there!&rdquo; barked a voice under his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, but it's those behind me,&rdquo; said Cutty, looking down into a florid
      countenance with a raggedy gray moustache and a pair of blue eyes that
      were blinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so damned short I can't see anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither can I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could if you wiped your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're crying yourself,&rdquo; declared Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blinking jackass! Got anybody out there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I get you, old son of a gun! No flesh and blood, but they're ours all the
      same. Couple of old fools; huh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure pop! What right have two old codgers got here, anyhow? What brought
      you out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brought you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn it! If I could only see something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty put his hands upon the shoulders of this chance acquaintance and
      propelled him toward the curb. There were cries of protest, curses,
      catcalls, but Cutty bored on ahead until he got his man where he could see
      the tin hats, the bayonets, and the colours; and thus they stood for a
      full hour. Each time the flag went by the little man yanked off his derby
      and turned truculently to see that Cutty did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he said as they finally dropped back, &ldquo;I'd offer to buy a drink,
      only it sounds flat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it would taste flat after a mighty wine like this,&rdquo; replied Cutty.
      &ldquo;Maybe you've heard of the nectar of the gods. Well, you've just drunk it,
      my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sure have. Those kids out there, smiling after all that hell; and you
      and me on the sidewalk, blubbering over 'em! What's the answer? We're
      Americans!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said it. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty pressed on to the flow and went along with it, lighter in the heart
      than he had been in many a day. These two million who lined Fifth Avenue,
      who cheered, laughed, wept, went silent, cheered again, what did their
      presence here signify? That America's day had come; that as a people they
      were homogeneous at last; that that which laws had failed to bring forth
      had been accomplished by an ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bolshevism, socialism&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;would beat itself
      into fragments against this Rock of Democracy, which went down to the
      centre of the world and whose pinnacle touched the stars. Reincarnation;
      the simple ideals of the forefathers restored. And with this knowledge
      tingling in his thoughts&mdash;and perhaps there was a bit of spring in
      his heart&mdash;Cutty continued on, without destination, chin jutting,
      eyes shining. He was an American!
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have continued on indefinitely had he not seen obliquely a window
      filled with musical instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley's fiddle! He had all but forgotten. All right. If the poor beggar
      wanted to scrape a fiddle, scrape it he should. The least he, Cutty, could
      do would be to accede to any and every whim Hawksley expressed. Wasn't he
      planning to rob the beggar of the drums, happen they ever turned up? But
      how the deuce to pick out a fiddle which would have a tune in it? Of all
      the hypercritical duffers the fiddler was the worst. Beside a fiddler of
      the first rank the rich old maid with the poodle was a hail fellow well
      met.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Gregor had taught the chap. That meant he would know instantly;
      just as his host would instantly observe the difference between green
      glass and green beryl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty turned into the shop, infinitely amused. Fiddles! What next? Having
      constituted a guardianship over Kitty, he was now playing impressario to
      Hawksley. As if he hadn't enough parts to play! Wouldn't he be risking his
      life to-night trying to find where Stefani Gregor was? Fiddles! Fiddles
      and emeralds! What a choice old hypocrite he was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fate has a way of telling you all about it&mdash;afterward; conceivably,
      that humanity might continue to reproduce its species. Otherwise humanity
      would proceed to extinguish itself forthwith. Thus, Cutty was totally
      unaware upon entering the shop that he was about to tear off its hinges
      the door he was so carefully bolting and latching and padlocking between
      Kitty Conover and this duffer who wanted to fiddle his way through
      convalescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there is fiddling there is generally dancing. If it be not the feet,
      then it will be the soul.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are some men who know a little about all things and a great deal
      about many. Such a man was Cutty. But as he approached the counter behind
      which stood an expectant clerk he felt for once that he was in a far
      country. There were fiddles and fiddles, just as there were emeralds and
      emeralds. Never again would he laugh over the story of the man who thought
      Botticelli was a manufacturer of spool thread. He attacked the problem,
      however, like the thoroughbred he was&mdash;frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to buy a violin,&rdquo; he began, knowing that in polite musical circles
      the word fiddle was taboo. &ldquo;I know absolutely nothing at all about quality
      or price. Understand, though, while you might be able to fool me, you
      wouldn't fool the man I'm buying it for. Now what would you suggest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk&mdash;a salesman familiar with certain urban types, thinly
      including the Fifth Avenue, which came in for talking-machine records&mdash;recognized
      in this well-dressed, attractive elderly man that which he designated the
      swell. Hateful word, yes, but having a perfectly legitimate niche, since
      in the minds of the hoi polloi it nicely describes the differences between
      the poor gentleman and the gentleman of leisure. To proceed with the
      digression, to no one is the word more hateful than to the individual to
      whom it is applied. Cutty would have blushed at the clerk's thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I'd better get the proprietor,&rdquo; was the clerk's suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Cutty agreed. &ldquo;Take my card along with you.&rdquo; This was a Fifth
      Avenue shop, and Cutty knew there would be a Who's Who or a Bradstreet
      somewhere about.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the interim he inspected the case-lined walls. Trombones. He chuckled.
      Lucky that Hawksley's talent didn't extend in this direction. True, he
      himself collected drums, but he did not play them. Something odd about
      music; human beings had to have it, the very lowest in the scale. A
      universal magic. He was himself very fond of good music; but these days he
      fought shy of it; it had the faculty of sweeping him back into the
      twenties and reincarnating vanished dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a certain length of time, from the corner of his eye he saw the
      clerk returning with the proprietor, the latter wearing an amiable smile,
      which probably connoted a delving into the aforesaid volumes of attainment
      and worth. Cutty hoped this was so, as it would obviate the necessity of
      going into details as to who he was and what he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name is familiar to me,&rdquo; began the proprietor. &ldquo;You collect antique
      drums. My clerk tells me that you wish to purchase a good violin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. I have in my apartment rather a distinguished guest who plays
      the violin for his own amusement. He is ill and cannot select for himself.
      Now I know a little about music but nothing about violins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suggest that I personally carry half a dozen instruments to your
      apartment and let your guest try them. How much is he willing to pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Top price, I should say. Shall I make a deposit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't mind. Merely precautionary. Half a dozen violins will
      represent quite a sum of money; and taxicabs are unreliable animals. A
      thousand against accidents. What time shall I call?&rdquo; The proprietor's
      curiosity was stirred. Musical celebrities, as he had occasion to know,
      were always popping up in queer places. Some new star probably, whose
      violin had been broken and who did not care to appear in public before the
      hour of his debut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three o'clock,&rdquo; said Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir. I promise to bring the violins myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty wrote out his check for a thousand and departed, the chuckle still
      going on inside of him. Versatile old codger, wasn't he?
    </p>
    <p>
      Promptly at three the dealer arrived, his arms and his hands gripping
      violin cases. Cutty hurried to his assistance, accepted a part of the
      load, and beckoned to the man to follow him. The cases were placed on the
      floor, and the dealer opened them, putting the rosin on a single bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley, a fresh bandage on his head, his shoulders propped by pillows,
      eyed the initial manoeuvres with frank amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, you know, would you mind tuning them for me? I'm not top hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dealer's eyebrows went up. An Englishman? Bewildered, he bent to the
      trifling labour of tuning the violins. Hawksley rejected the first two
      instruments after thrumming the strings with his thumb. He struck up a
      melody on the third but did not finish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word! If you have a violin there why not let me have it at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dealer flushed. &ldquo;Try this, sir. But I do not promise you that I shall
      sell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Hawksley stretched out his hands to receive the instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Cutty had heard of Amati and Stradivari, master and pupil. He
      knew that all famous violinists possessed instruments of these schools,
      and that such violins were practically beyond the reach of many. Only
      through some great artist's death or misfortune did a fine violin return
      to the marts. But the rejected fiddles had sounded musically enough for
      him and looked as if they were well up in the society of select fiddles.
      The fiddle Hawksley now held in his hands was dull, almost black. The
      maple neck was worn to a shabby gray and the varnish had been sweated off
      the chin rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley laid his fingers on the strings and drew the bow with a powerful
      flourishing sweep. The rich, sonorous tones vibrated after the bow had
      passed. Then followed the tricks by which an artist seeks to discover
      flaws or wolf notes. A beatific expression settled upon Hawksley face. He
      nestled the violin comfortably under his chin and began to play softly.
      Cutty, the nurse, and the dealer became images.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minors; a bit of a dance; more minors; nothing really begun, nothing
      really finished&mdash;sketches, with a melancholy note running through
      them all. While that pouring into his ears enchained his body it stirred
      recollections in Cutty's mind: The fair at Novgorod; the fiddling
      mountebanks; Russian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the dealer's astonishment was greatest. An Englishman! Who ever
      heard of an Englishman playing a violin like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will buy it,&rdquo; said Hawksley, sinking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; began the dealer, &ldquo;I am horribly embarrassed. I cannot sell that
      violin because it isn't mine. It is an Amati worth ten thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name a price,&rdquo; interrupted Hawksley, rather imperiously. &ldquo;I want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty understood that he was witnessing a flash of the ancient blood. To
      want anything was to have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat, sir, I cannot sell it. It belongs to a Hungarian who is now in
      Hungary. I loaned him fifteen hundred and took the Amati as security.
      Until I learn if he is dead I cannot dispose of the violin. I am sorry.
      But because you are a real artist, sir, I will loan it to you if you will
      make a deposit of ten thousand against any possible accident, and that
      upon demand you will return the instrument to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's fair enough,&rdquo; interposed Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; said Hawksley. &ldquo;I agree. I want it, but not at the price
      of any one's dishonesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his head toward Cutty, &ldquo;You're a thoroughbred, sir. This will do
      more to bring me round than all the doctors in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what the deuce is the difference?&rdquo; Cutty demanded with a gesture
      toward the rejected violins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dealer and Hawksley exchanged smiles. Said the latter: &ldquo;The other
      violins are pretty wooden boxes with tolerable tunes in their insides.
      This has a soul.&rdquo; He put the violin against his cheek again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massenet's &ldquo;Elegie,&rdquo; Moszkowski's &ldquo;Serenata,&rdquo; a transcription, and then
      the aria from Lucia. Not compositions professional violinists would have
      selected. Cutty felt his spine grow cold as this aria poured goldenly
      toward heaven. He understood. Hawksley was telling him that the shade of
      his glorious mother was in this room. The boy was right. Some fiddles had
      souls. An odd depression bore down upon him. Perhaps this surprising
      music, topping his great emotions of the morning, was a straw too much.
      There were certain exaltations that could not be sustained.
    </p>
    <p>
      A whimsical forecast: This chap here, in the dingy parlour of his Montana
      ranch, playing these indescribable melodies to the stars, his cowmen
      outside wondering what was the matter with their &ldquo;inards.&rdquo; Somehow this
      picture lightened the depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fingers are stiff,&rdquo; said Hawksley. &ldquo;My hand is tired. I should like to
      be alone.&rdquo; He lay back rather inertly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the corridor Cutty whispered to the dealer: &ldquo;What do you think of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he says, his touch shows a little stiffness, but the wonderful fire is
      there. He's an amateur, but a fine one. Practice will bring him to a
      finish in no time. But I never heard an Englishman play a violin like that
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; Cutty agreed. &ldquo;When the owner sends for that fiddle let me know.
      Mr. Hawksley might like to dicker for it. If you know where the owner is
      you might cable that you have an offer of twelve thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, but I haven't the least idea where the owner is. However,
      there is an understanding that if the loan isn't covered in eighteen
      months the instrument becomes salable for my own protection. There is a
      year still to run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Four o'clock found Cutty pacing his study, the room blue with smoke. Of
      all the queer chaps he had met in his varied career this Two-Hawks topped
      the lot. The constant internal turmoil that must be going on, the
      instincts of the blood&mdash;artist and autocrat! And in the end, the
      owner of a cattle ranch, if he had the luck to get there alive! Dizzy old
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something else happened at four o'clock. A policeman strolled into
      Eightieth Street. He was at peace with the world. Spring was in his
      whistle, in his stride, in the twirl of his baton. Whenever he passed a
      shop window he made it serve as a mirror. No waistline yet&mdash;a
      comforting thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children swarmed the street and gathered at corners. The older ones played
      boldly in midstreet, while the toddlers invented games that kept them to
      the sidewalk and curb. The policeman came stealthily upon one of these
      latter groups&mdash;Italians. At the sight of his brass buttons they fled
      precipitately. He laughed. Once in a month of moons he was able to get
      near enough to touch them. Natural. Hadn't he himself hiked in the old
      days at the sight of a copper? Sure, he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bit of colour on the sidewalk attracted his eye, and he picked up the
      object. Something those kids had been playing with. A bit of red glass out
      of a piece of cheap jewellery. Not half bad for a fake. He would put one
      over on Maggie when he turned in for supper. Certainly this was the age of
      imitation. You couldn't buy a brass button with any confidence. He put the
      trinket in his pocket and continued on, soon to forget it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six he was off duty. As he was leaving the precinct the desk sergeant
      called him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got change for a dollar, an' I'll settle that pinochle debt,&rdquo; offered the
      sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take a look.&rdquo; The policeman emptied his coin pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that yuh got there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The red stone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that? Picked it up on the sidewalk. Some Italian kids dropped it as
      they skedaddled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's have a look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; The policeman passed over the stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee! That looks like real money. Say, they can do anything with glass
      these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They sure can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man in civilian clothes&mdash;a detective from headquarters&mdash;went
      up to the desk. &ldquo;What you guys got there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ruby this boob picks up off'n the sidewalk,&rdquo; said the sergeant, winking
      at the finder, who grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's have a squint at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stone was handed to him. The detective stared at it carefully, holding
      it on his palm and rocking it gently under the desk light. Crimson darts
      of flame answered to this treatment. He pushed back his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you boobs!&rdquo; he drawled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matter? Why, this is a ruby! A whale of a ruby, an' pigeon blood at that!
      I didn't work in the' appraiser's office for nothing. But for a broken
      point&mdash;kids probably tried to crack it&mdash;it would stack up
      somewhere between three and four thousand dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant and the policemen barked simultaneously: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pigeon blood. Where was it you found it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Moses! On Eightieth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any chance of finding that bunch of kids?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a chance, not a chance! If I got the hull district here there
      wouldn't be nothin' doin'. The kids'd be too scared t' remember anything.
      A pigeon-blood ruby, an' I wasn't gonna pick it up at first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lock it up, sergeant,&rdquo; ordered the detective. &ldquo;I'll pass the word to
      headquarters. Too big for a ring. Probably fallen from a pin. But there'll
      be a holler in a few hours. Lost or stolen, there'll be some big noise.
      You two boobs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whadda yuh know about that?&rdquo; whined the policeman. &ldquo;An' me thinkin'
      it was glass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was no big noise. No one had reported the loss or theft of a
      pigeon-blood ruby of unusual size and quality.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kitty came home at nine that night, dreadfully tired. She had that day
      been rocked by so many emotions. She had viewed the parade from the
      windows of a theatrical agency, and she had cheered and cried like
      everybody else. Her eyes still smarted, and her throat betrayed her every
      time she recalled what she had seen. Those boys!
    </p>
    <p>
      Loneliness. She had dined downtown, and on the way home the shadow had
      stalked beside her. Loneliness. Never before had these rooms seemed so
      empty, empty. If God had only given her a brother and he had marched in
      that glorious parade, what fun they two would be having at this moment!
      Empty rooms; not even a pet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loneliness. She had been a silly little fool to stand so aloof, just
      because she was poor and lived in a faded locality. She mocked herself.
      Poor but proud, like the shopgirl in the movies. Denied herself
      companionship because she was ashamed of her genteel poverty. And now she
      was paying for it. Silly little fool! It wasn't as if she did not know how
      to make and keep friends. She knew she had attractions. Just a senseless
      false pride. The best friends in the world, after a series of rebuffs,
      would drop away. Her mother's friends never called any more, because of
      her aloofness. She had only a few girl friends, and even these no doubt
      were beginning to think her uppish.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not take off her hat and coat. She wandered through the empty
      rooms, undecided. If she went to a movie the rooms would be just as lonely
      when she returned. Companionship. The urge of it was so strong that there
      was a temptation to call up someone, even someone she had rebuffed. She
      was in the mood to confess everything and to make an honest attempt to
      start all over again&mdash;to accept friendship and let pride go hang.
      Impulsively she started for the telephone, when the doorbell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately the sense of loneliness fell away. Another chapter in the
      great game of hide and seek that had kept her from brooding until
      to-night? The doorbell carried a new message these days. Nine o'clock. Who
      could be calling at that hour? She had forgotten to advise Cutty of the
      fact that someone had gone through the apartment. She could not positively
      assert the fact. Those articles in her bureau she herself might have
      disturbed. She might have taken a handkerchief in a hurry, hunted for
      something under the lingerie impatiently. Still she could not rid herself
      of the feeling that alien hands had been rifling her belongings. Not
      Bernini, decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remembering Cutty's advice about opening the door with her foot against
      it, she peered out. No emissary of Bolshevisim here. A weary little
      messenger boy with a long box in his arms called her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miz Conover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy thrust the box into her hands and clumped to the stairhead. Kitty
      slammed the door and ran into the living room, tearing open the box as she
      ran. Roses from Cutty; she knew it. The old darling! Just when she was on
      the verge of breaking down and crying! She let the box fall to the floor
      and cuddled the flowers to her heart, her eyes filling. Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of those ideas which sometime or another spring into the minds of all
      pretty women who are poor sprang into hers&mdash;an idea such as an honest
      woman might muse over, only to reject. Sinister and cynical. Kitty was at
      this moment in rather a desperate frame of mind. Those two inherent
      characteristics, which she had fought valiantly&mdash;love of good times
      and of pretty clothes&mdash;made ingress easy for this sinister and
      cynical idea. Having gained a foothold it pressed forward boldly. Cutty,
      who had everything&mdash;strength, comeliness, wisdom, and money. To live
      among all those beautiful things, never to be lonely again, to be waited
      on, fussed over, made much of, taken into the high world. Never more to
      add up accounts, to stretch five-dollar bills across the chasm of seven
      days. An old man's darling!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; she burst out, passionately. She drew a hand across her
      eyes. As if that gesture could rub out an evil thought! It is all very
      well to say &ldquo;Avaunt!&rdquo; But if the idea will not? &ldquo;I couldn't, I couldn't!
      I'd be a liar and a cheat. But he is so nice! If he did want me!... No,
      no! Just for comforts! I couldn't! What a miserable wretch I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught up the copper jug and still holding the roses to her heart, the
      tears streaming down her cheeks, rushed out to the kitchen for water. She
      dropped the green stems into the jug, buried her face in the buds to cool
      the hot shame on her cheeks, and remembered&mdash;what a ridiculous thing
      the mind was!&mdash;that she had three shirt waists to iron. She set the
      jug on the kitchen table, where it remained for many hours, and walked
      over to the range, to the flatiron shelf. As she reached for a flatiron
      her hand stopped in midair.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fat black wallet! Instantly she knew who had placed it there. That poor
      Johnny Two-Hawks!
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty lifted out the wallet from behind the flatirons. No doubt of it,
      Johnny Two-Hawks had placed it there when she had gone to the speaking
      tube to summon the janitor. Not knowing if he would ever call for it!
      Preferring that she rather than his enemies should have it. And without a
      word! What a simple yet amazing hiding place; and but for the need of a
      flatiron the wallet would have stayed there until she moved. Left it
      there, with the premonition that he was heading into trouble. But what if
      they had killed him? How would she have explained the wallet's presence in
      her apartment? Good gracious, what an escape!
    </p>
    <p>
      Without direct consciousness she raised the flap. She saw the edges of
      money and documents; but she did not touch anything. There was no need.
      She knew it belonged to Johnny Two-Hawks. Of course there was an appalling
      attraction. The wallet was, figuratively, begging to be investigated. But
      resolutely she closed the flap. Why? Because it was as though Two-Hawks
      had placed the wallet in her hands, charging her to guard it against the
      day he reclaimed it. There was no outward proof that the wallet was his.
      She just knew, that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, she examined the outside carefully. In one corner had been
      originally a monogram or a crest; effectually obliterated by the
      application of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who he was and what he was, by a simple turn of the wrist. It was Cutty's
      affair now, not hers. He had a legal right to examine the contents. He was
      an agent of the Federal Government. The drums of jeopardy and Stefani
      Gregor and Johnny Two-Hawks, all interwoven. She had waited in vain for
      Cutty to mention the emeralds. What signified his silence? She had
      indirectly apprised him of the fact that she knew the author of that
      advertisement offering to purchase the drums, no questions asked. Who but
      Cutty in New York would know about them? The mark of the thong. Johnny
      Two-Hawks had been carrying the drums, and Karlov's men had torn them from
      their victim's neck during the battle. Was there any reason why Cutty
      should not have taken her completely into his confidence? Palaces looted.
      If Stefani Gregor had lived in a palace, why not his protege? Still, it
      was possible Cutty was holding back until he could tell her everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what to do with it? If she called him up and made known her discovery,
      Cutty would rush up as fast as a taxicab could bring him. He had
      peremptorily ordered her not to come to his apartment for the present. But
      to sit here and wait, to be alone again after he had gone! It was not to
      be borne. Orders or no orders, she would carry the wallet to him. He could
      lecture her as much as he pleased. To-night, at least, she would lay aside
      her part as parlour maid in the drama. It would give her something to do,
      keep her mind off herself. Nothing but excitement would pull her out of
      this semi-hysterical doldrum.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hid the wallet in the pocket of her underskirt. Already her blood was
      beginning to dance. She ran into her bedroom for two veils, a gray
      automobile puggree and one of those heavy black affairs with butterflies
      scattered over it, quite as effectual as a mask. She wound the puggree
      about her hat. When the right moment came she would discard the puggree
      and drop the black veil. Her coat was of dark blue, lined with steel-gray
      taffeta. Turned inside out it would fool any man. She wore spats. These
      she would leave behind when she made the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone might follow her as far as the Knickerbocker, but beyond there,
      never. She was sorry, but she dared not warn Bernini. He might object,
      notify Cutty, and spoil everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time she reached the street exhilaration suffused her. The
      melancholia was gone. The sinister and cynical idea had vanished
      apparently. Apparently. Merely it had found a hiding place and was content
      to abide there for the present. Such ideas are not without avenues of
      retreat; they know the hours of attack. Kitty was alive to but one fact:
      The game of hide and seek was on again. She was going to have some
      excitement. She was going into the night on an adventure, as children play
      at bears in the dark. The youth in her still rejected the fact that the
      woof and warp of this adventure were murder and loot and pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      En route to the Subway she never looked back. At Forty-second Street she
      detrained, walked into the Knickerbocker, entered the ladies dressing
      room, turned her coat, redraped her hat, checked her gaiters, and sought a
      taxi. Within two blocks of Cutty's she dismissed the cab and finished the
      journey on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the left of the lobby was an all-night apothecary's, with a door going
      into the lobby. Kitty proceeded to the elevator through this avenue.
      Number Four was down, and she stepped inside, raising her veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very important. Take me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boss is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter. Take me up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're the doctor!&rdquo; What a pretty girl she was. No come-on in her eyes,
      though. &ldquo;The boss may not get back until morning. He just went out in his
      engineer's togs. He sure wasn't expecting you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where he went?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never know. But I'll be in this bird cage until he comes back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to wait for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up she goes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Kitty stepped out into the corridor a wave of confusion assailed her.
      She hadn't planned against Cutty's absence. There was nothing she could
      say to the nurse; and if Johnny Two-Hawks was asleep&mdash;why, all she
      could do would be to curl up on a divan and await Cutty's return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse appeared. &ldquo;You, Miss Conover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Kitty realized at once that she must take the nurse into her
      confidence. &ldquo;I have made a really important discovery. Did Cutty say when
      he would return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I am not in his confidence to that extent. But I do know that you
      assumed unnecessary risks in coming here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty shrugged and produced the wallet. &ldquo;Is Mr. Hawksley awake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears that he left this wallet in my kitchen that night. It might
      buck him up if I gave it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse, eyeing the lovely animated face, conceded that it might. &ldquo;Come,
      I've been trying futilely to read him asleep, but he is restless. No
      excitement, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll try not to. Perhaps, after all, you had better give him the wallet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, that would start a series of questions I could not
      answer. Come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Kitty saw Hawksley she gave a little gasp of astonishment. Why, he
      was positively handsome! His dark head, standing out boldly against the
      bolstering pillows, the fine lines of his face definite, the pallor&mdash;he
      was like a Roman cameo. Who and what could he be, this picturesque
      foundling?
    </p>
    <p>
      His glance flashed into hers delightedly. For hours and hours the constant
      wonder where she was, why no one mentioned her, why they evaded his
      apparently casual questions. To burst upon his vision in the nadir of his
      boredom and loneliness like this! She was glorious, this American girl.
      She made him think of a golden scabbard housing a fine Toledo blade.
      Hadn't she saved his life? More, hadn't she assumed a responsibility in so
      doing? Instantly he purposed that she should not be permitted to resign
      the office of good Samaritan. He motioned toward the nurse's chair; and
      Kitty sat down, her errand in total eclipse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just when I never felt so lonely! Ripping!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His quick smile was so engaging that Kitty answered it&mdash;kindred
      spirits, subconsciously recognizing each other. Fire; but neither of them
      knew that; or that two lonely human beings of opposite sex, in touch,
      constitute a first-rate combustible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quietly the nurse withdrew. There would be a tonic in this meeting for the
      patient. Her own presence might neutralize the effect. She had not spent
      all those dreadful months in base hospitals without acquiring a keen
      insight into the needs of sick men. No harm in letting him have this
      pretty, self-reliant girl alone to himself for a quarter of an hour. She
      would then return with some broth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;how are you?&rdquo; asked Kitty, inanely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Top-hole, considering. Quite ready to be killed all over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't talk like that!&rdquo; she protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to show you I was bucking up. Thank you for doing what you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most women would have run away and left me to my fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not my kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather not! Your kind would risk its neck to help a stray cat. I say,
      what's that you have in your hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; Kitty extended the wallet. &ldquo;It is yours, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I wanted you to bring it to me the way you have. If I hadn't come
      back&mdash;out of that&mdash;it was to be yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine?&rdquo;&mdash;dumfounded. &ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Gregor gone, there wasn't a soul in the world. I was hungry, and
      you gave me food. I wanted that to pay you. I'll wager you've never looked
      into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no right to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See!&rdquo; He opened the wallet and spread the contents on the counterpane. &ldquo;I
      wasn't so stony as you thought. What? Cash and unregistered bonds. They
      would have been yours absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't&mdash;I can't quite,&rdquo; Kitty stammered&mdash;&ldquo;but I couldn't
      have kept them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively yes. You would have shown them to that ripping guardian of
      yours, and he would have made you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, yes! He would have been scared to death. You poor man, can't you
      see? Circumstantial evidence that I had killed you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord! And you're right, too! So it goes. You can't do anything you
      want to do. The good Samaritan is never requited; and I wanted to break
      the rule. Lord, what a bally mix-up I'd have tumbled you in! I forgot that
      you were you, that you would have gone straight to the authorities. Of
      course I knew if I pulled through and you found the wallet you would bring
      it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty no longer had a foot on earth. She floated. Her brain floated, too,
      because she could not make it think coherently for her. A fortune&mdash;for
      a dish of bacon and eggs! The magnificence, the utter prodigality of such
      generosity! For a dish of bacon and eggs and a bottle of milk! Had she
      left home? Hadn't she fallen asleep, the victim of another nightmare? A
      corner of the atmosphere cleared a little. A desire took form; she wanted
      the nurse to come back and stabilize things. In a wavering blur she saw
      the odd young man restore the money and bonds and other documents to the
      wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to give this to your guardian when he comes in. I want him to
      understand. I say, you know, I'm going to love that old thoroughbred! He's
      fine. Fancy his carrying me on his shoulders and eventually bringing me up
      here among the clouds! Americans.... Are you all like that? And you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's brain began to make preparations to alight, as it were. Cutty.
      That gave her a touch of earth. She heard herself say faintly: &ldquo;And what
      about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were brave and kind. To help an unknown, friendless beggar like that,
      when you should have turned him over to the police! Makes me feel a bit
      stuffy. They left me for dead. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If&mdash;it wouldn't have been just as well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't talk like that! You just mustn't! You're with friends, real
      friends, who want to help you all they can.&rdquo; And then with a little flash
      of forced humour, because of the recurrent tightening in her throat&mdash;&ldquo;Who
      could be friendless, with all that money?&rdquo; Instantly she felt like biting
      her tongue. He would know nothing of the sad American habit of trying to
      be funny to keep a wobbly situation on its legs. He would interpret it as
      heartlessness. &ldquo;I didn't mean that!&rdquo; With the Irish impulsiveness which
      generally weighs acts in retrospection, she reached over and gripped his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, you two!&rdquo; Hawksley closed his eyes for a second. &ldquo;Wanting to buck
      up a chap because you re that sort! All right. I'll stick it out! You two!
      And I might be the worst scoundrel unhung!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew her hand toward his lips, and Kitty had not the power to resist
      him. She felt strangely theatrical, a character in a play; for American
      men, except in playful burlesque, never kissed their women's hands. The
      moment he released the hand the old wave of hysteria rolled over her. She
      must fly. The desire to weep, little fool that she was! was breaking
      through her defences. Loneliness. The two of them all alone but for Cutty.
      She rose, crushing the wallet in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, never had she needed that darling mother of hers so much as now. Tears
      did not seem to afford relief when one shed them into handkerchiefs and
      pillows. But on that gentle bosom, to let loose this brimming flood, to
      hear the tender voice consoling!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, now! Please!&rdquo; she heard Johnny Two-Hawks cry out.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she rushed on blindly, knocking against the door jamb and almost
      upsetting the nurse, who was returning. Somehow she managed to reach the
      living room, glad it was dark. Alter sundry reaching about she found the
      divan and flung herself upon it. What would he think? What would the nurse
      think? That Kitty Conover had suddenly gone stark, raving crazy! And now
      that she was in the dark, alone, the desire to weep passed over and she
      lay quietly with her face buried in the pillow. But not for long.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat up. Music&mdash;violin music! A gay waltz that made her think of
      flashing water, the laughter of children. Tschaikowsky. Thrilled, she
      waited for the finale. Silence. Scharwenka's &ldquo;Polish Dance,&rdquo; with a swing
      and a fire beyond anything she had ever heard before. Another stretch of
      silence&mdash;a silence full of interrogation points. Then a tender little
      sketch, quite unfamiliar. But all at once she understood. He was imploring
      her to return. She smiled in the dark; but she knew she was going to
      remain right where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Conover?&rdquo; It was the voice of the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I'm over here on the divan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, no! I'm overtired. A little hysterical, maybe. The parade
      to-day, with all those wounded boys in automobiles, the music and colour
      and excitement&mdash;have rather done me up. And the way I rushed up here.
      And not finding Cutty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything I can get for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks. I'll try to snatch a little sleep before Cutty returns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he may be gone all night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it be so very scandalous if I stay here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor child! Go ahead and sleep. Don't hesitate to call me if you want
      anything. I have a mild sedative if you would like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks. I did not know that Mr. Hawksley played.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderfully! But does it bother you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It kind of makes me choky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty, now strangely at peace, snuggled down among the pillows. Some great
      Polish violinist, who had roused the bitter enmity of the anarchist? But
      no; he was Russian. Cutty had admitted that. It struck her that Cutty knew
      a great deal more than Kitty Conover; and so far as she could see there
      was no apparent reason for this secrecy. She rather believed she had
      Cutty. Either he should tell her everything or she would run loose,
      Bolshevik or no Bolshevik.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheep. She boosted one over the bars, another and another. Round somewhere
      in the thirties the bars dissolved. The next thing she knew she was
      blinking in the light, Cutty, his arms folded, staring down at her
      sombrely. There was blood on his face and blood on his hands.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Karlov moodily touched the shoulder of the man on the cot. Stefani Gregor
      puzzled him. He came to this room more often than was wise, driven by a
      curiosity born of a cynical philosophy to discover what it was that
      reenforced this fragile body against threats and thirst and hunger. He
      knew what he wanted of Gregor&mdash;the fiddler on his knees begging for
      mercy. And always Gregor faced him with that silent calm which reminded
      him of the sea, aloof, impervious, exasperating. Only once since the day
      he had been locked in this room had Gregor offered speech. He, Karlov, had
      roared at him, threatened, baited, but his reward generally had been a
      twisted wintry smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not offer physical torture beyond the frequent omissions of food
      and water; the body would have crumbled. To have planned this for months,
      and then to be balked by something as visible yet as elusive as
      quicksilver! Born in the same mudhole, and still Boris Karlov the avenger
      could not understand Stefani Gregor the fiddler. Perhaps what baffled him
      was that so valiant a spirit should be housed in so weak a body. It was
      natural that he, Boris, with the body of a Carpathian bear, should have a
      soul to match. But that Stefani, with his paper body, should mock him! The
      damned bourgeoisie!
    </p>
    <p>
      The quality of this unending calm was understandable: Gregor was always
      ready to die. What to do with a man to whom death was release? To hold the
      knout and to see it turn to water in the hand! In lying he had
      overreached. Gregor, having accepted as fact the reported death of Ivan,
      had nothing to live for. Having brought Gregor here to torture he had,
      blind fool, taken away the fiddler's ability to feel. The fog cleared. He
      himself had given his enemy this mysterious calm. He had taken out
      Gregor's soul and dissipated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. Not quite dissipated. What held the body together was the iron residue
      of the soul. Venom and blood clogged Karlov's throat. He could kill only
      the body, as he had killed the fiddle; he could not reach the mystery
      within. Ah, but he had wrung Stefani's heart there. There were pieces of
      the fiddle on the table where Gregor had placed them, doubtless to weep
      over when he was alone. Why hadn't he thought to break the fiddle a little
      each day?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stefani Gregor, sit up. I have come to talk.&rdquo; This was formula. Karlov
      did not expect speech from Gregor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the thin arms bore up the torso; slowly the legs swung to the
      floor. But the little gray man's eyes were bright and quick to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boris, what is it you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To talk&rdquo;&mdash;surprised at this unexpected outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. I mean, what is it all about&mdash;these killings, these
      burnings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Karlov was ready at all times to expound the theories that appealed to his
      dark yet simple mind&mdash;humanity overturned as one overturned the sod
      in the springtime to give it new life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To give the proletariat what is his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the little man on the cot. &ldquo;What is his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That which capitalism has taken away from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The proletariat. The lowest in the human scale&mdash;and therefore the
      most helpless. They shall rule, say you. My poor Russia! Beaten and robbed
      for centuries, and now betrayed by a handful of madmen&mdash;with brains
      atrophied on one side! You are a fool, Boris. Your feet are in strange
      quicksands and your head among chimeras. You write some words on a piece
      of paper, and lo! you say they are facts. Without first proving your
      theories correct you would ram them down the throat of the world. The
      world rejects you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait and see, damned bourgeoisie!&rdquo; thundered Karlov, not alive to the
      fact that he was being baited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bourgeoisie? Yes, I am of the middle class; the rogue on top and the fool
      below. I see. The rogue and the fool cannot combine unless the bourgeoisie
      is obliterated. Go on. I am interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under the soviet the government shall be everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it was in Prussia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Karlov ignored this. &ldquo;The individual shall never again become rich by
      exploiting the poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Karlov strove to speak calmly. Gregor's willingness to discuss the aims of
      the proletariat confused him. He suspected some ulterior purpose behind
      this apparent amiability. He must hold down his fury until this purpose
      was in the open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is good,&rdquo; Gregor admitted. &ldquo;But somehow it sounds ancient on
      my ear. Was there not a revolution in France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool, it is the world that is revolting!&rdquo; Karlov paused. &ldquo;And no man in
      the future shall see his sister or his daughter made into a loose woman
      without redress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your proletariat's sister and daughter. But the daughter of the noble and
      the daughter of the bourgeoisie&mdash;fair game!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes there enters a man's head what might be called a sick idea; when
      the vitality is at low ebb and the future holds nothing. Thus there was a
      grim and sick idea behind Gregor's gibes. It was in his mind to die. All
      the things he had loved had been destroyed. So then, to goad this madman
      into a physical frenzy. Once those gorilla-like hands reached out for him
      Stefani Gregor's neck would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be still, fiddler! You know what I mean. There will be no upper class,
      which is idleness and wastefulness; no middle class, the usurers, the
      gamblers of necessities, the war makers. One great body of equals shall
      issue forth. All shall labour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The common good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Lenine offered peace, bread, and work for the overthrow of Kerensky.
      What you have given&mdash;murder and famine and idleness. Can there be
      common good that is based upon the blood of innocents? Did Ivan ever harm
      a soul? Have I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; Karlov trembled. &ldquo;You&mdash;with your damned green stones! Did you
      not lure Anna to dishonour with the promise to show her the drums, the
      sight of which would make all her dreams come true? A child, with a fairy
      story in her head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak of Anna! If you hadn't been spouting your twaddle in taverns
      you would have had time to instruct Anna against guilelessness and
      superstition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much did they pay you? Did you fiddle for her to dance?... But I left
      their faces in the mud!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A madman, with two obsessions. A pitiable Samson with his arms round the
      pillars of society to drag it down upon his head because society had
      defiled his sister! Ah, how many thousands in Russia like him! A great
      yearning filled Gregor's heart, because he understood; but he suppressed
      expression of it because the sick idea was stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! I loved those green stones because it was born in me to love
      beautiful things. Have you forgotten, Boris, the old days in Moscow, when
      we were students and I made you weep with my fiddle? There was hope for
      you then. You had not become a pothouse orator on the rights of the
      proletariat&mdash;the red-combed rooster on the smouldering dungheap!
      Beauty, no matter in what form, I loved it. Yes, I was mad about those
      emeralds. I was always stealing in to see them, to hold them to the light,
      simply because they were beautiful.&rdquo; Gregor's hands flew to his throat,
      which he bared. &ldquo;I lured her there! 'Twas I, Boris!... Those beautiful
      hands of yours, fit for the butcher's block! Kill me! Kill me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Karlov shrank back, covering his eyes. &ldquo;No! I see now! You wish to
      die! You shall live!&rdquo; He rushed toward the far wall, a huge grotesque
      shadow rising to meet him&mdash;his own, thrown upon the wall by the
      wavering candlelight. He turned shaking, for the temptation had been
      great.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once Gregor realized his failure. The tenseness went out of him. He
      spoke calmly. &ldquo;Yes, I wanted to die. I no longer possess anything. I lied,
      Boris; but it is useless to tell you that. I knew nothing of Anna until it
      was too late. I wanted to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Karlov began to pace furiously, the candle flame springing after him each
      time he passed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a question in Gregor's mind. It rushed to his lips a dozen times
      but he dared not voice it. Olga. Since Karlov could not be tempted to
      murder, it would be futile to ask for an additional burden of mental
      torture. Perhaps it had not happened&mdash;the terrible picture he drew in
      his mind&mdash;since Karlov had not boasted of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Boris. There is blood on your hands. What is one more daub of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Karlov stopped, scowled, and ran his fingers through his hair. Perhaps
      some ugly memory stirred the roots of it. &ldquo;You wish to die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregor bent his head to his hands and Karlov resumed his pacing. After a
      while Gregor looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Private vengeance. You begin your rule with private vengeance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vengeance of a people. All the breed. Did France stop at Louis? Do we
      tear up the roots of the poisonous toadstool that killed someone we loved
      and leave the other toadstools thriving?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To cure the world of all its ills by tearing up the toadstools and the
      flowers together&mdash;do you call that justice? The proletariat shall
      have everything, and he begins by killing off noble and bourgeoisie and
      dividing up the loot! Even with his oppression the noble had a right to
      live. The bourgeoisie must die because of his benefactions to a people.
      The world for the proletariat, and damnation for the rest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let each become one of us,&rdquo; cried Karlov, hoarsely. &ldquo;We give them that
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie! You have done nothing but assassinate them when they
      surrendered. But tell me, have not you, Lenine, and Trotzky overlooked
      something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Karlov was vaguely grateful for this diversion. The lust to kill
      was still upon him and he was fighting it. He must remember that Gregor
      wished to die. &ldquo;What have we overlooked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Human nature. Can you tear it apart and reconstruct it, as you would a
      clock? What of creative genius in this proletariat millennium of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The state will carefully mother that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gregor laughed sardonically. &ldquo;Will there be creative genius under your
      rule? Will you not suffocate it by taking away the air that energizes it&mdash;ambition?
      You will have all the present marvels of invention to start with, but will
      you ever go beyond? Have you read history and observed the inexorable? I
      doubt it. What is progress? A series of almost imperceptible steps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which capitalism has always obstructed,&rdquo; flung back Karlov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which capitalism has always made possible. Curb it, yes; but abolish it,
      as you have done in unhappy Russia! Why do you starve there? Poor fool,
      because you have assassinated those forces which created food&mdash;that
      is to say, put it where you could get it. Three quarters of Russia are
      against you. You read nothing in that? The efficient and the inefficient,
      they shall lie down together as the lion and the ass, to paraphrase. They
      shall become equal because you say so. What is, fundamentally, this
      Bolshevism? The revolt of the inefficient. The mantle of horror that was
      Germany's you have torn from her shoulders and thrown upon yours. Fools!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The anarch's huge fists became knotted; wrinkles corrugated his forehead;
      but he did not stir. Gregor wanted to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregor pointed with trembling hand toward the brown litter on the table.
      &ldquo;To destroy. You shattered a soul there. You tore mine apart when you did
      it. For what? To better humanity? No; to rend something, to obliterate
      something that was beautiful. Demolition. Go on. You will tear and rend
      until exhaustion comes, then some citizen king, some headstrong Napoleon,
      will step in. The French Revolution taught you nothing. You play 'The
      Marseillaise' in the Neva Prospekt and miss the significance of that song.
      Liberty? You choose license. Equality? You deny it in your acts.
      Fraternity? You slaughter your brothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent!&rdquo; roared Karlov, wavering.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gregor continued with a new-found hope. He saw that his jeers were
      wearing down the other's control. Perhaps the weak side was the political.
      Karlov was a fanatic. There might yet be death in those straining fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To seize by confiscation, without justice, indiscriminately all that the
      group efficient laboriously constructed. I enter your house, kill your
      family and steal your silver. Are your acts fundamentally different from
      mine? Remember, I am speaking from the point of view as three quarters of
      Russia see it, and all the other civilized nations. There may be something
      magnificent in that soviet constitution of yours; but you have deluged it
      in blood and folly. Ostensibly you are dividing up the great estates, but
      actually you are parcelling them out and charging rent. You will not own
      anything. The state shall own all the property. What will be the
      patriotism of the man who has nothing? Why defend something that is only
      his government's, not his own? You are legalizing women as cows. The sense
      of motherhood will vanish when a woman may not select her mate. What is
      the greatest thing in the world? The human need of possession. To own
      something, however little. The spur of creative genius. Human beings will
      never be equal except in lawful privileges. The skillful will outpace the
      unskillful; the thrifty will take from the improvident; genius will
      overtop mediocrity. And you will change all this with a scrape of your
      bloody pen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Karlov's body began to rock and sway like an angry bear's; but still he
      held his ground. Gregor wanted to die, to cheat him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of power?&rdquo; went on his baiter. &ldquo;Capitalism of might. Lenine and
      Trotzky; are they&mdash;have they been&mdash;honest? Has Russia actually
      voted them into office? They sit in the seats of the mighty by the
      capitalism of force. For the capitalism of money, which is progress
      physical and moral, you substitute the capitalism of force, which is
      terror. You speak of yourselves as internationalists. Bats, that is the
      judgment day of God&mdash;internationalism! For only on the judgment day
      will nations become a single people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A short silence. Gregor was beginning to grow weak. Presently he picked up
      the thread of his diatribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lived in England, France, Italy, and here. I am competent to draw
      comparisons. Where you went to distill poison I went to absorb facts. And
      I found that here in this great democracy is the true idea. But you will
      not read the lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sweat began to drop from Karlov's beetling eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will fail miserably here. Why? Because the Americans are the greatest
      of individual property owners. The sense of possession is satisfied. And
      woe to the fool who suggests they surrender this. Little wooden houses,
      thousands and thousands of them, with a small plot of ground in the rear
      where a man in the springtime may dig his hands into the soil and say
      gratefully to God, 'Mine, mine!' I, too, am a Russ. I thought in the
      beginning that you would take this country as an example, a government of
      the people, by the people, for the people. Wrongs? Yes. But day by day
      these wrongs are being righted. No lesson in this for Trotzky, a beer-hall
      orator like yourself. Ten million men drafted to carry arms. Did they
      revolt? Shoulder to shoulder the selected millions marched to the great
      ships, shoulder to shoulder they pressed toward the Rhine. No lesson in
      that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capitalism, seeking to save its loans, you rant! Capitalism of blood and
      money that asked only for simple justice to mankind. The ideal of a great
      people&mdash;a mixture of all bloods, even German! No lessons in these
      tremendous happenings! And you babble about your damned proletariat who
      represents the dregs of Russia. What is he? The inefficient, whining that
      the other man has the luck, so kill him! Russia, the kindly ox, fallen
      among wolves! You cannot tear down the keystone of civilization&mdash;which
      took seven thousand years to construct&mdash;insert it upside down, and
      expect the arch to stand. You have your chance to prove your theories.
      Prove them in Petrograd and Moscow, and you will not have to go forth with
      the torch. And what is this torch but the hidden fear that you may be
      wrong?... To wreck the world before you are found out! You are idiots, and
      you have turned Russia into a madhouse! Spawns from the dung-heap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you, Stefani Gregor!&rdquo; Karlov rushed to the cot, raised his terrible
      fists, his chest heaving. Gregor waited. &ldquo;No, no! You wish to die!&rdquo; The
      madman swung on his heels and dashed toward the door, sweeping the pieces
      of the violin to the floor as he passed the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregor feebly drew himself back upon his cot and laid his face in the
      pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ivan&mdash;my violin&mdash;all that I knew and loved&mdash;gone! And God
      will not let me die!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      From a window in one of the vacant warehouses, twenty-odd feet away Cutty,
      from an oblique angle, had witnessed the peculiar drama without being able
      to grasp head or tail to it. For two hours he had crouched behind his
      window, watching the man on the cot and wondering if he would ever turn
      his face toward the candlelight. Then Karlov had entered. Gregor's ironic
      calm&mdash;with the exception of the time he had bared his throat&mdash;and
      Karlov's tempestuous exit baffled him. To the eye it had the appearance of
      a victory for Gregor and a defeat for Karlov, but Cutty had long ago
      ceased to believe his eyes without some corroborative evidence of
      auricular character.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had recognized both men. Karlov answered to Kitty's description as an
      old glove answers to the hand. And no man, once having seen Gregor, could
      possibly forget his picturesque head. The old chap was alive! This fact
      made the night's adventure tally one hundred per cent. How to get a cheery
      word to him, to buck him up with, the promise of help? A hard nut to
      crack; so many obstacles. Primarily, this was a Federal affair. Yonder hid
      the werewolf and his pack, and it would be folly to send them scattering
      just for the sake of advising Gregor that he was being watched over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Underneath the official obligation there was a personal interest in not
      risking the game to warn Gregor. Cutty was now positive that the drums of
      jeopardy were hidden somewhere in this house. To perform three acts, then:
      Save Gregor, capture Karlov and his pack, and privately confiscate the
      emeralds. Findings were keepings. No compromise regarding those green
      stones. It would not particularly hurt his reputation with St. Peter to
      play the half rogue once in a lifetime. Besides, St. Peter, hadn't he
      stolen something himself back there in the Biblical days; or got into a
      scrape or something? The old boy would understand. Cutty grinned in the
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any obsession is a blindfold. A straight course lay open to Cutty, but he
      chose the labyrinthian because he was obsessed. He wanted those emeralds.
      Nothing less than the possession of them would, to his thinking, round out
      a varied and active career. Later, perhaps, he would declare the stones to
      the customs and pay the duty; perhaps. Thus his subsequent mishaps this
      night may be laid to the fact that he thought and saw through green
      spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea that the jewels were hidden near by made it imperative that he
      should handle this affair exclusively. Coles, the operative he had sent to
      negotiate with Karlov, was conceivably a prisoner upstairs or down. Coles
      knew about the drums, and they must not turn up under his eye. Federal
      property, in that event.
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever he laid his hands upon the drums he would buy something gorgeous
      for Kitty. Little thoroughbred!
    </p>
    <p>
      Time for work. Without doubt Karlov had cellar exits through this
      warehouse or the other. The job on hand would be first to locate these
      exits, and then to the trap on the roof. With his pocket lamp blazing a
      trail he went down to the cellar and carefully inspected the walls that
      abutted those of the house. Nothing on this side.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the warehouse and hugged the street wall for a space. The street
      was deserted. Instead of passing Karlov's abode he wisely made a detour of
      the block. He reached the entrance to the second warehouse without
      sighting even a marauding tom. In the cellar of this warehouse he
      discovered a newly made door, painted skillfully to represent the
      limestone of the foundation. Tiptop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately he outlined the campaign. There should be two drives&mdash;one
      from the front and another from the roof&mdash;so that not an anarchist or
      Bolshevik could escape. The mouth of the Federal sack should be held at
      this cellar exit. No matter what kind of game he played offside, the raid
      itself must succeed absolutely. Nothing should swerve him from making
      these plans as perfect as it was humanly possible. He would be on hand to
      search Karlov himself. If the drums were not on him he would return and
      pick the old mansion apart, lath by lath. Gay old ruffian, wasn't he?
    </p>
    <p>
      Another point worth considering: He would keep his discoveries under cover
      until the hour to strike came. Some over-zealous subordinate might attempt
      a coup on his own and spoil everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked his way to the far end of the cellar, to the doors. Locks gone.
      He took it for granted that the real-estate agent would not come round
      with prospective tenants. These doors would take them into the trucking
      alley, where there were a dozen feasible exits. There was no way out of
      the house yard, as the brick wall, ten feet high and running from
      warehouse to warehouse, was blind. Now for the trap on the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      He climbed the three flights of stairs crisscrossed and festooned with
      ancient cobwebs. Occasionally he sneezed in the crook of his elbow,
      philosophizing over the fact that there was a lot of deadwood property in
      New York. Americans were eternally on the move.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window from which he intended dropping to the house roof was obdurate.
      Only the upper half was movable. With hardly any noise at all he pulled
      this down, straddled it, balanced himself, secured a good grip on the
      ledge, and let himself down. The tips of his shoes, rubber-soled, just
      reached the roof. He landed silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glare of the street lamp at the corner struck the warehouse, and this
      indirect light was sufficient to work by. He made the trap after a series
      of extra-cautious steps. The roof was slanting and pebbled, and the least
      turn of the foot might start a cascade and bell an alarm. A comfort-loving
      dress-suiter like himself, playing Old Sleuth, when he ought to be home
      and in bed! It was all of two-thirty. What the deuce would he do when
      there were no more thrills in life?
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped and caught hold of a corner of the trap to test it&mdash;and
      drew back with a silent curse. Glass! He had cut his hand. The beggars had
      covered the trap with cement and broken glass, sealing it. It would take
      time to cut round the trap; and even then he wouldn't be sure; they might
      have nailed it down from the inside. The worst of it was he would have to
      do the work himself; and in the meantime Karlov would have a fair wind for
      his propaganda gas, and perhaps the disposal of the drums to some
      collector who wasn't above bargaining for smuggled emeralds. Odd, though,
      that Karlov should have made a prisoner of Coles. What lay behind that
      manoeuvre? Well, this trap must be liberated; no getting round that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hang it, he wasn't going to be dishonest exactly; it would be simply a
      double play, half for Uncle Sam and half for himself. The idea of offering
      freely his blood and money to Uncle Sam and at the same time putting one
      over on the old gentleman had a novel appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up and wiped a tickling cobweb from his cheek. As the window from
      which he had descended came into range he stared, loose-jawed. Then be
      chuckled, as thoroughbred adventurers generally chuckle when they find
      themselves at the bottom of the sack, the mouth of which has
      simultaneously and automatically closed. Wasn't he the brainy old top?
      Wasn't he Sherlock Holmes plus? Old fool, how the devil was he going to
      get back through that window?
    </p>
    <p>
      The drums of jeopardy&mdash;even to think of them was unlucky! Not to have
      planned a retreat; to have climbed down a well and cut the bucket rope!
      For in effect that was precisely what he had done. Only wings could carry
      him up to that window. With sardonic humour he felt of his shoulder
      blades. Not a feather in sight. Then he touched his ears. Ah, here was
      something definite; they had grown several inches during the past few
      hours. Monumental ass!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course there would be the drain. He could escape; but, dear Lord! with
      enough noise to wake the dead. And that would write &ldquo;Finis&rdquo; to this
      particular adventure. The quarry and the emeralds would be gone before he
      could return with help. When everything had gone so smoothly&mdash;a jolt
      like this!
    </p>
    <p>
      A crowded day, and no mistake, as full of individual acts as a bill at a
      vaudeville, trained-animal act last. Was it possible that he had gone
      fiddle hunting that morning, netting an Amati worth ten thousand dollars?
      Hawksley&mdash;no, he couldn't blame Hawksley. Still, if this young
      Humpty-Dumpty hadn't been pushed off his wall he, Cutty, would not now be
      marooned upon this roof 'twixt the devil and the deep blue sea. To remain
      here until sunrise would be impossible; to slide down the drain was
      equally impossible&mdash;that is, if he ever wanted to see Boris Karlov
      again. The way of the transgressor was hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat on his heels and let his gaze rove four-square, permitting no
      object to escape. He saw a clothes pole leaning against the chimney.
      Evidently the former tenants had hung up their laundry here. There was no
      clothesline, however. Caught, jolly well, blooming well caught! If ever
      this got abroad he would be laughed out of the game. He wasn't going to
      put one over on Uncle Sam after all. There might be some kind of a fire
      escape on the front of the house. No harm in taking a look; it would serve
      to pass the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the usual frontal parapet about three feet in height. Upturned
      in the shadow lay a gift from the gods-a battered kitchen chair, probably
      used to reach the clothesline in the happy days when the word &ldquo;Bolshevism&rdquo;
       was known to only a select few dark angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty waved a hand cheerfully if vaguely toward his guiding star, picked
      up the chair, commandeered the clothes pole, and silently manoeuvred to
      the wall of the warehouse. Standing on the chair he placed the tip of the
      pole against the top of the upper frame and pushed the frame halfway up.
      He repeated this act upon the obdurate lower half. He heaved slowly but
      with all his force. Glory be, the lower half went up far enough to afford
      ingress! He would eat his breakfast in the apartment as usual. To-morrow
      night he would establish his line of retreat by fetching a light rope
      ladder. There was sweat at the roots of his hair, however, when he finally
      gained the street. He was very tired. He observed mournfully that the
      vigour which had always recharged itself, no matter how recklessly he had
      drawn upon it, was beginning to protest. Fifty-two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, his troubles were over for the night. So he believed. Arriving home,
      dirty and spent, he had to find Kitty asleep on the divan!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; he said, breaking the tableau, &ldquo;what are you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been hurt! There is blood on you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A trifling cut. But I'm hurt, nevertheless, that you should be so
      thoughtless as to come here against my orders. It doesn't matter that
      Karlov has given up the idea of having you followed. But for the sake of
      us all you must be made to understand that we are dealing with high
      explosives and poison gas. It's not what might happen to me or to Uncle
      Sam's business. It's you. Any moment they may take it into their heads to
      get at me and Hawksley through you. That's why we watch over you. You
      don't want to see Hawksley done in, do you? It's real tragedy, Kitty, and
      nobody can guess what the end is going to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's lip quivered. &ldquo;Cutty, if you talk like that to me I shall cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, what about?&rdquo;&mdash;bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About everything. I've been on the verge of hysterics all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, you poor child, what's happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;everything. Lonesome. When I saw all those mothers and
      wives and sisters and sweethearts on the curb to-day, watching their boys
      march by, it hit me hard. I was alone. Nobody. So please don't be cross
      with me. I'm on the ragged edge. Silly, I know. But we women often go to
      pieces over nothing, without any logical reason. Ready to face murder and
      battle and sudden death; and then to blow up, as you men say it, over
      nothing. I had to move, go somewhere, do something; so I came here. But I
      came on&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;official business. Here!&rdquo; She
      offered him the wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belongs to Johnny Two-Hawks. He hid it that night behind my flatirons on
      the range. Why, Cutty, he's rich!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he show the contents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the money and the bonds. He said if he had died the money and bonds
      would have been mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Providing Gregor was also dead.&rdquo; Cutty looked into the wallet, but
      disturbed nothing. &ldquo;I imagine these funds are actually Gregor's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me to give the wallet to you. And so I waited. I fell asleep. So
      please don't scold me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a brute! But it's because you've become so much to me that I was
      angry. You're Tommy and Molly's girl, and I've got to watch out for you
      until you reach some kind of a port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for the flowers. You'll never know just what they did for me.
      There was somebody who gave me a thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, I honestly don't get you. A beauty like you, lonesome!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it. I am pretty. Why should I deny it? If I'd been homely I
      shouldn't have been ashamed to invite my friends to my shabby home. I
      shouldn't have cold shouldered everybody through false pride. But where
      have you been, and what have you been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Official business. But I just missed being a fine jackass. I'll look into
      the wallet after I've cleaned up. I'm a mess of gore and dust. Is it
      interesting stuff?&rdquo; dreading her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wallet? I did not look into it. I had no right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Well, I'll be back in two jigs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried off, relieved to learn that the secret was still beyond Kitty's
      knowledge. Of course Hawksley wouldn't carry anything in the wallet by
      which his true identity might be made known. Still, there would be stuff
      to excite her interest and suspicion. Hawksley had shown her some of that
      three hundred thousand probably. What a game!
    </p>
    <p>
      He would say nothing about his own adventures and discoveries. He worked
      on the theory that the best time to tell about something was after it had
      become a fact. But no theory is perfect; and in this instance his
      reticence was going to cost him intolerable agony in the near future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a quarter of an hour he was back in the living room. Kitty was out
      of sight; probably had curled up on the divan again. He would not disturb
      her. Hawksley's wallet! He drew a chair under the reading lamp and
      explored the wallet. Money and bonds he rather expected, but the customs
      appraiser's receipt was like a buffet. The emeralds belonged honorably to
      his guest! All his own plans were knocked galley-west by this discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      An odd sense of indignation blazed up in him, as though someone had
      imposed upon him. The sport was gone, the fun of the thing; it became
      merely official business. To appropriate a pair of smuggled emeralds was a
      first-class sporting proposition, with a humorous twist. As it stood now,
      he would be picking Hawksley's pocket; and he wasn't rogue enough for
      that. Hang the luck!
    </p>
    <p>
      Emeralds, rubies, sapphires, pearls, and diamonds! No doubt many of them
      with histories&mdash;in a bag hung to his neck&mdash;and all these
      thousands of miles! Not since the advent of the Gaekwar of Baroda into San
      Francisco, in 1910, had so many fine stones passed through that port of
      entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why hadn't Hawksley inquired about them? Stoic indifference? A good
      loser? How had he got through the customs without a lot of publicity? The
      Russian consul of the old regime probably; and an appraiser who was a good
      sport. To have come safely to his destination, and then to have lost out!
      The magnificent careless generosity of putting the wallet behind Kitty's
      flatirons, to be hers if he didn't pull through! Why, this fiddling
      derelict was a man! Stood up and fought Karlov with his bare fists; wasn't
      ashamed to weep over his mother's photograph; and fiddled like Heifetz.
      All right. This Johnny Two-Hawks, as Kitty persisted in calling him, was
      going to reach his Montana ranch. His friend Cutty would take it upon
      himself to see to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck him that after all he would have to play the game as he had
      planned it. Those gems falling into the hands of the Federal agents would
      surely bring to light Hawksley's identity; and Hawksley should have his
      chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty then came upon the will. Somehow the pathos of it went deep into his
      heart. The poor devil!&mdash;a will that hadn't been witnessed, the
      handwriting the same as that on the passport. If he had fallen into the
      hands of the police they would have justifiably locked him up as a murder
      suspect. Two-Hawks! It was a small world. He returned the contents to the
      wallet, leaving out the will, however. This he thrust into a drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee?&rdquo; said Kitty at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty? I'd forgotten you! I thought I smelt coffee. Just what I wanted,
      too, only I hadn't brains enough left to think of it. Smells better than
      anything Kuroki makes.... Tastes better, too. You're going to make some
      lucky duffer a fine wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything you can tell me, Cutty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A whole lot, Kitty; only I'm twenty years too old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the wallet. Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty drained the cup slowly. A good coherent lie, to appease Kitty's
      curiosity; half a truth, something hard to nail. He set down the empty
      cup, building. By the time he had filled his pipe and lit it he was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something bored up through the subconscious, however&mdash;a query. Why
      hadn't he told her the plain truth at the start? Wasn't on account of the
      drums. He hadn't kept her in the dark because of the drums. He could have
      trusted her with that part of it&mdash;his tentative piracy. That to
      divulge Hawksley's identity would be a menace to her peace of mind now
      appeared ridiculous; and yet he had worked forward from this assumption.
      No answer to the query. Generally he thought clearly enough; but somewhere
      along this route he had made a muddle of things and couldn't find the
      spot. The only point clearly defined was that he should wish to keep her
      out of the affair because there were elements of positive danger. But
      somewhere inside of him was a question asking for recognition, and it
      eluded him. Nothing could be solved until this question got out of the
      fog. Even now he might risk the whole truth; but the lie he had woven
      appeared too good to waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Human frailty. The most accomplished human being is the finished liar.
      Never to forget a detail, to remember step by step the windings, over a
      ticklish road. And Cutty, for all his wide newspaper experience, was a
      poor liar because he had been brought up on facts. Perhaps his lie might
      have passed had he not been so fagged. The physical labours of the night
      had dulled his perceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ab, but that tastes good!&rdquo;&mdash;as he blew forth a wavering ring of
      smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to have at least one merit,&rdquo; replied Kitty, wrinkling her nose.
      What a fine profile Cutty had! &ldquo;Now, who and what is he? I'm dying to
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An odd story; probably hundreds like it. You see, the Bolsheviki have
      driven out of the country or killed all the nobles and bourgeoisie. Some
      of them have escaped&mdash;into China, Sweden, India, wherever they could
      find an open route. To his story there are many loose ends, and Hawksley
      is not the talking kind. You mustn't repeat what I tell you. Hawksley,
      with all that money and a forged English passport, would have a good deal
      of trouble explaining if he ran afoul the police. There is no real proof
      that the money is his or Gregor's. As a matter of fact, it is Gregor's,
      and Hawksley was bringing it to him. Hawksley is Gregor's protege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty nodded. This dovetailed with what Johnny Two-Hawks had told her that
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the two came together originally I don't know. Gregor was in his
      younger days a great violinist, but unknown to the American public. Early
      in his career he speculated with his concert earnings and turned a pot of
      money. He dropped the professional career for that of a country gentleman.
      He had a handsome estate, and lived sensibly. He sent Hawksley to England
      to school and spent a good deal of time there with him, teaching him how
      to play the fiddle, for which it seems Hawksley had a natural bent. He had
      to Anglicize his name; for Two-Hawks would have made people laugh. To be a
      gentleman, Kitty, one does not have to be a prince or a grand duke. Gregor
      was a polished gentleman, and he turned Hawksley into one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Kitty nodded, her eyes sparkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Russ&mdash;the educated Russ&mdash;is a queer biscuit. Got to have a
      finger in some political pie, and political pies in Russia before the war
      were lese-majesty. The result&mdash;Gregor got in wrong with his secret
      society and the political police and was forced to fly to save his life.
      But before he fled he had all his convertible funds transferred. Only his
      estate was confiscated. Hawksley was in London when the war broke out.
      There was a lot of red tape, naturally, regarding the funds. I shan't
      bother you with that, Hawksley, hoping to better his protector's future,
      returned to Russia and joined his regiment and fought until the Czar
      abdicated. Foretasting the trend of events, he tried to get back to
      England, but that was impossible. He was permitted to retire to the Gregor
      estate, where he remained until the uprising of the Bolsheviki. Then he
      started across the world to join Gregor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was brave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly was. I imagine that Hawksley's journey has that of Ulysses
      laid away on the shelf. Karlov was the head of the society which had voted
      Gregor's death. So he had agents watching Hawksley. And Karlov himself
      undertook the chase across Russia, China, and the Pacific.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad I gave him something to eat. But Gregor, a valet in a hotel,
      with all that money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The red tape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a dizzy world we live in, Cutty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dizzy is the word.&rdquo; Cutty sighed. His yarn had passed a very shrewd
      censor. &ldquo;Karlov feels it his duty to kill off all his countryman who do
      not agree with his theories. He wanted these funds here, but Hawksley was
      too clever for him. Remember, now, not a word of this to Hawksley. I tell
      you this in confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to spend the night here. It's round four, and the power has
      been shut off. There's the stairs, but it would be dawn before you reach
      the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. I don't believe you're in a good mood to send back to that garlicky
      warren. I wish to the Lord you'd leave it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's difficult to find anything desirable within my means. Rents are
      terrifying. I'll sleep on the divan. A rug or a blanket. I'm a silly fool,
      I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have a guest room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather the divan; less scandalous. Cutty, I forgot. He played for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? He did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to run out of the room because some things he said choked me up.
      Didn't care whether he died or not. He was even lonelier than I. I lay
      down on the divan, and then I heard music. Funny, but somehow I fancied he
      was calling me back; and I had to hang on to the divan. Cutty, he is a
      great violinist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you fond of music?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am mad about it! I'm always running round to concerts; and I'd walk
      from Battery to Bronx to hear a good violinist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiddles and Irish hearts. Swiftly came the vision of Hawksley fiddling the
      heart out of this lonely girl&mdash;if he had the chance. And he, Cutty,
      was going to fascinate her&mdash;with what? He rose and took her by the
      shoulders, bringing her round so that the light was full in her face.
      Slate-blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, what would you say if I kissed you?&rdquo; Inwardly he asked: &ldquo;Now, what
      the devil made me say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sinister and cynical idea leaped from its ambush. &ldquo;Why, Cutty, I&mdash;I
      don't believe I should mind. It's&mdash;it's you!&rdquo; Vile wretch that she
      was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty, noting the lily succeeding the rose, did not kiss her. Fate has a
      way of reversing the illogical and giving it logical semblance. It was
      perfectly logical that he should not kiss her; and yet that was exactly
      what he should have done. The fatherliness of the salute&mdash;and he
      couldn't have made it anything else&mdash;would have shamed Kitty's
      peculiar state of mind out of existence and probably sent back to its
      eternal sleep that which was strangely reawaking in his lonely heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Kitty. That wasn't exactly nice of me, even if I was trying
      to be funny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tore away from him, flung herself upon the divan, her face in the
      pillows, and let down the dam.
    </p>
    <p>
      This wild sobbing&mdash;apparently without any reason terrified Cutty. He
      put both hands into his hair, but he drew them out immediately without
      retaining any of the thinning gray locks. Done up, both of them; that was
      the matter. He longed to console her, but knew not what to say or how to
      act. He had not seen a woman weep like this in so many years that he had
      forgotten the remedies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should he call the nurse? But that would only add to Kitty's
      embarrassment, and the nurse would naturally misinterpret the situation.
      He couldn't kneel and put his arms round her; and yet it was a situation
      that called for arms and endearments. He had sense enough to recognize
      that. Molly's girl crying like that, and he able to do nothing! It was
      intolerable. But what was she weeping about?
    </p>
    <p>
      Covering the divan was a fine piece of Bokhara embroidery. He drew this
      down over Kitty and tucked her in, turned off the light, and proceeded to
      his bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's sobs died eventually. There was an occasional hiccup. That, too,
      disappeared. To play&mdash;or even think of playing&mdash;a game like
      that! She was despicable. A silly little fool, too, to suppose that so
      keen a mind as Cutty's would not see through the artifice! What was
      happening to her that she could let such a thought into her head?
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by she was able to pick up Cutty's narrative and review it. Not a
      word about the drums of jeopardy, the mark of the thong round Hawksley's
      neck. Hadn't she let him know that she knew the author of that
      advertisement offering to buy the drums, no questions asked? Very well,
      then; if he would not tell her the truth she would have to find it out
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Cutty sat on the edge of his bed staring blankly at the rug,
      trying to find a pick-up to the emotions that beset him. One thing issued
      clearly: He had wanted to kiss the child. He still wanted to kiss her. Why
      hadn't he? Unanswerable. It was still unanswerable even when the pallor of
      dawn began slowly to absorb the artificial light of his bed lamp.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Cutty awoke&mdash;having had about two hours' sleep&mdash;he was
      instantly conscious that the zest had gone from the adventure. It had
      resolved itself into official business into which he had projected himself
      gratuitously; and having assumed the offices of chief factor, he would
      have to see the affair through, victim of his own greediness. It did not
      serve to marshal excuses. He had frankly entered the affair in the role of
      buccaneer; and here he was, high and dry on the reef.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drums of jeopardy, so far as he was concerned, had been shot into the
      moon two hundred thousand miles out of reach. He found himself resenting
      Hawksley's honesty in the matter of the customs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But immediately this sense of resentment caused him to chuckle. Certainly
      some ancestor of his had been a Black Bart or a Galloping Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would put a few straight questions to Hawksley, however. To have lost
      all those precious stones and not to have inquired about them was a bit
      foggy, wasn't normal, human. Unless&mdash;bang on the plexus came the
      thought!&mdash;the beggar had hidden them himself. He had been exceedingly
      clever in hiding the wallet. Come to think of it, he hadn't mentioned
      that, either. Of course he had hidden the stones&mdash;either in Gregor's
      apartment or in Kitty's. Blind as a bat. Now he understood why Karlov had
      made a prisoner of Coles. The old buzzard had sensed a trap and had
      countered it. The way of the transgressor was hard. His punishment for
      entertaining a looter's idea would be work when he wanted to loaf and
      enjoy himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at Hawksley's door he was confronted by a spectacle not without
      its humorous touch: The nurse extending a bowl and Hawksley staring at the
      sky beyond the window, stonily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must!&rdquo; insisted Miss Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chops or beefsteak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will give you nausea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to find out. Dash it, I'm hungry!&rdquo; Hawksley declared. &ldquo;I'm no
      fever patient. A smart rap on the head; nothing more than that. Healthy
      food will draw the blood down from there. Haven't lost anything but a few
      hours of consciousness, and you treat me as though I'd been jolly well
      peppered with shrapnel and gassed. Touch that stuff? Rather not! Chops or
      beefsteak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him have it, Miss Frances,&rdquo; advised Cutty from the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's unusual,&rdquo; replied the nurse as a final protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it a try. Is he strong enough to sit up through breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's really not fit. But if he insists on doing the one he might as well
      do the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Righto!&rdquo;&mdash;from the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell Kuroki to make it a beefsteak breakfast for four? I know
      how Mr. Hawksley feels. Been through the same bout.&rdquo; Cutty wanted Miss
      Frances out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Only, I've warned him.&rdquo; Miss Frances left, somewhat miffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Hawksley, smiling. &ldquo;She thinks I'm a canary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereas you're an eagle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or a vulture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty chew up a chair. &ldquo;Frankly, I believe a good breakfast will put you a
      peg up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beefsteak!&rdquo; Hawksley stared ecstatically at the ceiling. &ldquo;You see, I'm
      naturally tough. Always went in for rough sports&mdash;football, rowing,
      boxing. Poor old Stefani's idea; and not so bad, either. Of course he was
      always worrying about my hands; but I always took great care to keep them
      soft and pliant. Which sounds rummy, considering the pounding I used to
      give and take. My word, I used to go to bed with my hands done up in
      ointments like a professional beauty! Of course I'm dizzy yet, and the
      bally spot is sore; but solid food and some exercise will have me off your
      hands in no time. I don't fancy being coddled, y'know. I've been trouble
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let that worry you. I'll bring some togs in; flannels and soft
      shirts. We're about the same height. Anyhow, the difference won't be
      noticeable in flannels. I've had to tell Miss Conover a bit of fiction.
      I'll tell you, so if need arises you can back me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Cutty finished his romance Hawksley frowned. &ldquo;All said and done, if
      I'm not that splendid old chap's protege, what am I? But for his patience
      and kindness I'd have run true to the blood. He was with me at the
      balancing age, when a chap becomes a man or a rotter. He actually gave up
      a brilliant career because of me. He is a great musician, with that
      strange faculty of taking souls out of people and untwisting them. I have
      the gift, too, in a way; but there's always a bit of the devil in me when
      I play. Natural bent, I fancy. And they've killed him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cutty, slowly. &ldquo;But this is for your ear alone: He's alive; and
      one of these days I'll bring him to you. So buck up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alive! Stefani alive!&rdquo; whispered Hawksley. He stretched out his hand
      rather blindly, and Cutty was surprised at the strength of the grip.
      &ldquo;Makes me feel choky. I say, are all Americans good Samaritans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty put this aside because he did not care to disillusion Hawksley. &ldquo;I
      found an appraiser's receipt in your wallet. You carried some fine jewels.
      Did you hide them or did Karlov get them? It struck me as odd that you
      haven't inquired about them.&rdquo; The change that came into Hawksley's face
      alarmed Cutty. The rich olive skin became chalky and the eyes closed.
      &ldquo;What is it? Shall I call Miss Frances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Hawksley opened his eyes, but looked dully straight ahead. &ldquo;The
      stones! I was trying to forget! My God, I was trying to forget!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they were yours?&rdquo; Cutty was mystified beyond expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mine, mine, mine!&rdquo;&mdash;panting. &ldquo;Damn them! Some day I'll tell
      you. But just now I can't toe the mark. I was trying to forget them!
      Against my heart, gnawing into my soul like the beetle of the Spanish
      Inquisition!&rdquo; Silence. &ldquo;But they were future bread and butter&mdash;for
      Gregor as well as for myself. They got them, and may they damn Karlov as
      they have damned me! I had no chance when I returned to Gregor's. They
      were on me instantly. I put up a fight, but I'd come from a lighted room
      and was practically blind. Let them go. Most of those stones came out of
      hell, anyhow. Let them go. There is an unknown grave between those stones
      and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The level despair of the tone appalled Cutty. A crime somewhere? There was
      still a bottom to this affair he had not plumbed? He rose, deeply
      agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll fetch those togs for you. Miss Conover will breakfast with us, and
      the sight of her will give you a brace. I'm sorry. I had to ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beefsteak and a pretty girl! That's something. I suppose she was trapped
      by the lift not running.&rdquo; Hawksley was trying to meet Cutty halfway to
      cover up the tragedy. &ldquo;I say, why the deuce do you let her live where she
      does?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I'm not legally her guardian. She is the daughter of the man and
      woman I loved best. All I can do is to watch over her. She lives on her
      earnings as a newspaper writer. I'd give her half of all I have if I had
      the least idea she would accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fond of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fond of her!&rdquo; repeated Cutty. &ldquo;Why, of course I'm fond of her!&rdquo; There was
      a touch of indignation in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she fond of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo; What was the chap driving at?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then marry her,&rdquo; suggested Hawksley with a cynical smile; &ldquo;make a
      settlement and give her her freedom. Simple enough. What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty stepped back, stunned and terrified. &ldquo;She would laugh at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never can tell,&rdquo; replied Hawksley, maintaining the crooked smile. The
      devil was blazing in his eyes now. &ldquo;Try it. It's being done every day;
      even here in this big America of yours. From the European point of view
      you have compromised her&mdash;or she has compromised herself, by spending
      the night here. Convention has been disregarded. A ripping good chance, I
      call it. You tell me she wouldn't accept benefits, and you want to help
      her. If she's the kind I believe her to be, even if she refuses you she
      will not be angry. You never can tell what woman will or won't do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An old and forgotten bit of mental machinery began to set up a
      ditter-datter in Cutty's brain. Marry Kitty? Make a settlement, and then
      give her her freedom? Rot! Girls of Kitty's calibre were above such
      expediencies. He tried to resurrect his interest in the drums of jeopardy,
      which he might now appropriate without having to shanghai his conscience.
      The clitter-clatter smothered it; indeed, this new racket upset and
      demoralized the well-ordered machinery of his thinking apparatus as
      applied daily. Marry Kitty!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm old enough to be her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that to do with it so long as convention is satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty was so shaken and confused that he missed the tragic irony of the
      voice. All the receptive avenues to his brain seemed to have shut down
      suddenly. He was conscious only of the clitter-clatter. Marry Kitty!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't settle money on her,&rdquo; went on Hawksley, &ldquo;without scandal. You
      can't offer her anything without offending her. And you can't let her go
      to rust without having her bit of good times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Utterly impossible,&rdquo; said Cutty, to the idea rather than to his
      tormentor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course, if you have an affair&mdash;No, God forgive me, I don't
      mean that! I'm a damned ingrate! But your bringing up those stones and
      knocking off the top of all the misery piling up in my heart! I was only
      trying to hurt you, hurt myself, everybody. Please have a little patience
      with me, for I've come out of hell!&rdquo; Hawksley turned aside his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buck up,&rdquo; said Cutty, his blazing wrath dropping to a smoulder. &ldquo;I'll
      fetch those togs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What had the boy done to fill him with such tragic bitterness? Was he
      Two-Hawks? Cutty dismissed this doubt instantly. He recalled the episode
      of the boy's conduct when confronted by the photograph of his mother. No
      human being could be a play actor in such a moment. The boy's emotion had
      been deep and real. Cutty recognized the fact that he had become as a
      block in the middle of a Chinese puzzle; only Fate could move him to his
      appointed place.
    </p>
    <p>
      But offer marriage to Kitty so that he could provide for her! Mechanically
      he rummaged his clothes press for the suit he was to take to Hawksley.
      Well, why not? He could settle five thousand a year on her. His departure
      for the Balkans&mdash;he might be gone a year or more&mdash;could be
      legally construed as desertion. And with pretty clothes and freedom she
      would soon find some young chap to her liking. But would a girl like Kitty
      see it from his point of view? The marriage could take place an hour or
      two before he went aboard his ship. Hang it, Hawksley wasn't so far off.
      Kitty couldn't possibly be offended if he laid the business squarely on
      the table. To provide for Molly's girl!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Kuroki announced that breakfast was ready, Cutty went into the living
      room for Kitty, whom he had not yet seen. He found her by a window
      fascinated by the splendour of the panorama as seen in the morning light.
      Not a vestige of the tears and disorder in which he had left her. What had
      been behind those tears? Dainty and refreshing; to the eye as though she
      had stepped out of a bandbox. Compromised? That was utter rot! Wasn't Miss
      Frances here? Clitter-clatter, clitter-clatter. But Cutty was not aware
      that it was no longer in his head but in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breakfast is served, Your Highness,&rdquo; he announced with a grave salaam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty pirouetted. For some reason she could not explain to herself she
      wanted to laugh, sing, dance. Perhaps it was because she was only
      twenty-four. Or it might have had its origin in the tonicky awakening
      among all these beautiful furnishings.
    </p>
    <p>
      She assumed a haughty expression&mdash;such as the Duchess of Gerolstein
      assumes when she appoints the private to the office of generalissimo&mdash;and
      with a careless wave of the hand said: &ldquo;Summon His Highness!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Between Cutty's heart and his throat there was very little space at that
      moment for the propelment of sound. Kitty Conover had innocently&mdash;he
      understood that almost immediately and recovered his mental balance&mdash;Kitty
      had innocently thrown a bomb at his feet. It did not matter that it was a
      dud. The result was the same. For a second, then, all the terror, all the
      astounding suspension of thought and action attending the arrival of a
      shell on the battlefield were his. As an aftermath he would have liked
      very much to sit down. Instead, maintaining the mock gravity of his
      expression, he offered his arm, which Kitty accepted, still the Grand
      Duchess of Gerolstein. Pompously they marched into the dining room. But as
      Kitty saw Hawksley she dropped the air confusedly, and hesitated. &ldquo;Good
      gracious!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; Cutty whispered in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My clothes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I slept in them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If that wasn't like a woman! It did not matter how she might look to an
      old codger, aetat. fifty-two; he didn't count. But a handsome young chap,
      now, in white flannels and sport shirt, his head bound picturesquely&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let that bother you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Those duds of his are mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still, Cutty was grateful for this little diversion. As he drew back
      Kitty's chair he was wholly himself again. At once he dictated the trend
      of the conversation, moved it whither he willed, into strange channels,
      gave them all a glimpse of his amazing versatility, with vivid shafts of
      humour to light up corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kuroki, who had travelled far with his master these ten years, sometimes
      paused in his rounds to nod affirmatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley listened intently, wondering a bit. What was the dear old
      beggar's idea, throwing such fireworks round at breakfast? He stole a
      glance at Kitty to see how she was taking it&mdash;and caught her stealing
      a glance at him. Instantly both switched back to Cutty. Shortly the little
      comedy was repeated because neither could resist the invisible force of
      some half-conscious inquiry. Third time, they smiled unembarrassedly. Mind
      you, they were both hanging upon Cutty's words; only their eyes were like
      little children at church, restless. It was spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without being exactly conscious of what he was doing, Hawksley began to
      dress Kitty&mdash;that is, he visualized her in ball gowns, in sports, in
      furs. He put her on horses, in opera boxes, in limousines. But in none of
      these pictures could he hold her; she insisted upon returning to her
      kitchen to fry bacon and eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a twisted thought, rejected only to return; a surprising
      thought, so alluring that the sense of shame, of chivalry, could not press
      it back. Cutty's words began to flow into one ear and out of the other,
      without sense. There was in his heart&mdash;put there by the recollection
      of the jewels&mdash;an indescribable bitterness, a desperate cynicism that
      urged him to strike out, careless of friend or foe. Who could say what
      would happen to him when he left here? A flash of spring madness, then to
      go forth devil-may-care.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was really beautiful, full of unsuspected fire. To fan it into white
      flame. The whole affair would depend upon whether she cared for music. If
      she did he would pluck the soul out of her. She had saved his life. Well,
      what of that? He had broken yonder man's bread and eaten his salt. Still,
      what of that? Hadn't he come from a race of scoundrels? The blood&mdash;he
      had smothered and repressed it all his life&mdash;to unleash it once,
      happen what might. If she were really fond of music!
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again Kitty's glance roved back to Hawksley. This time she
      encountered a concentration in his unwavering stare. She did not quite
      like it. Perhaps he was only thinking about something and wasn't actually
      seeing her. Still, it quieted down the fluttering gayety of her mood.
      There was a sun spot of her own that became visible whenever her interest
      in Cutty's monologue lagged. Perhaps Hawksley had his sun spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; she heard Cutty say. &ldquo;Mr. Hawksley is going to become an
      American citizen. Kitty, what are some of the principles of good
      citizenship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be nice to policemen. Not to meddle with politics, because it is
      vulgar. To vote perfunctorily. To 'let George do it' when there are
      reforms to be brought about. To keep your hat on when the flag goes by
      because otherwise you will attract attention. To find fault without being
      able to offer remedies. To keep in debt because life here in America would
      be monotonous without bill collectors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty interrupted with a laugh. &ldquo;Kitty, you'll 'scare Hawksley off the
      map!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him know the worst at once,&rdquo; retorted Kitty, flashing a smile at the
      victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoofing me&mdash;what?&rdquo; said Hawksley, appealing to his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      This quality of light irony in a woman was a distinct novelty to Hawksley.
      She had humour, then? So much the better. An added zest to the game he was
      planning. He recalled now that she was not of the clinging kind either. A
      woman with a humorous turn of mind was ten times more elusive than a
      purely sentimental one. Give him an hour or two with that old Amati&mdash;if
      she really cared for music! She would be coming to the apartment again&mdash;some
      afternoon, when his host was out of the way. Better still, he would call
      her by telephone; the plea of loneliness. Scoundrel? Of course he was. He
      was not denying that. He would embark upon this affair without the smug
      varnish of self-lies. Fire&mdash;to play with it!
    </p>
    <p>
      He ate his portion of beefsteak, potatoes, and toast, and emptied his
      coffee cup. It was really the first substantial meal he had had in many
      hours. A feeling of satisfaction began to permeate him. He smiled at Miss
      Frances, who shook her head dubiously. She could not quite make him out
      pathologically. Perhaps she had been treating him as shell-shocked when
      there was nothing at all the matter with his nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Kuroki came in with a yellow envelope, which he laid at the side
      of Cutty's plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telegrams!&rdquo; exploded Cutty. &ldquo;Hang it, I don't want any telegrams!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open it and have it over with,&rdquo; suggested Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the worst kind of news&mdash;a summons to Washington for
      conference. Which signified that the Government's plans were completed and
      that shortly he would be on his way to Piraeus.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fine muddle! Hawksley in no condition to send upon his way; Kitty's
      affair unsettled; the emeralds still in camera obscura; Karlov at liberty
      with his infernal schemes, and Stefani Gregor his prisoner. Wild horses,
      pulling him two ways. A word, and Karlov would come to the end of his rope
      suddenly. But if he issued that word the whole fabric he had erected so
      painstakingly would blow away like cardboard. If those emeralds turned up
      in the possession of any man but himself the ensuing complications would
      be appalling. For he himself would be forced to tell what he knew about
      the stones: Hawksley would be thrust conspicuously into the limelight, and
      sooner or later some wild anarch would kill him. Known, Hawksley would not
      have one chance in a thousand. Kitty would be dragged into the light and
      harassed and his own attitude toward her misunderstood. All these things,
      if he acted upon his oath. Nevertheless, he determined to risk suspension
      of operations until he returned from Washington. There was one sound plank
      to cling to. He had first-hand information that anarchistic elements would
      remain in their noisome cellars until May first. If he were not ordered
      abroad until after that, no harm would follow his suspension of
      operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad news?&rdquo; asked Kitty, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aggravating rather than bad. I am called to Washington. May be gone four
      or five days. Official business. Leaves things here a bit in the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll stay as long as you need me,&rdquo; said Miss Frances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather a man now. You've been a brick. You need rest. I've a chap in
      mind. He'll make our friend here toe the mark. A physical instructor,
      ex-pugilist; knows all about broken heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, that's ripping!&rdquo; cried Hawksley. &ldquo;Give me your man, and I'll be
      off your hands within a week. The sooner you stop fussing over me the
      sooner the crack in my head will cease to bother me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kuroki will cook for you and Ryan will put you through the necessary
      stunts. The roof, when the weather permits, makes a good exercising
      ground. If you'll excuse me I'll do some telephoning. Kuroki, pack my bag
      for a five-day trip to Washington. I'll take you down to the office,
      Kitty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't fancy I ever will quite understand you,&rdquo; said Hawksley, leaning
      back in his chair, listlessly. &ldquo;Honestly, now, you'd be perfectly
      justified in bundling me off to some hotel. I have funds. Why all this
      pother about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty smiled. &ldquo;When I tackle anything I like to carry it through. I want
      to put you on your train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be reasonably sure that I shan't come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely&rdquo;&mdash;but without smiling. With a vague yet inclusive nod
      Cutty hurried off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because he is such a thorough sportsman. Mr. Hawksley,&rdquo; Kitty
      explained. &ldquo;Having accepted certain obligations he cannot abrogate them
      off hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I bother you last night? I mean, did my fiddling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, no! From the hurdy-gurdy of my childhood, down to Kubelik and his
      successors, I have been more or less music-mad. You play&mdash;wonderfully!&rdquo;
       Sudden, inexplicable shyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley smiled. An hour or two with that old Amati.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only an unconventional amateur. You should hear Stefani Gregor when
      the mood is on. He puts something into your soul that makes you wish to go
      forth at once to do some fine, unselfish act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stefani Gregor! He thought of the clear white soul of the man who had
      surrendered imperishable fame to stand between him and the curse of his
      blood; who had for ten years stood between his mother and the dissolute
      man whom irony had selected for the part of father. Ten years of
      diplomacy, tact, patience. Stefani Gregor! There was the blood, predatory
      and untamed; and there was the spirit which the old musician had moulded.
      He could not harm this girl. Dead or alive, Stefani Gregor would not
      permit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley rose slowly and without further speech walked to the corridor
      door. He leaned against the jamb for a moment, then went on to his
      bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid that breakfast was too much for him,&rdquo; the nurse ventured. &ldquo;An
      odd young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; replied Kitty, rather absently. She was trying to analyze that
      flash of shyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, Cutty sat down before the telephone. He wanted Kitty out of town
      during his absence. In her present excitable mood he was afraid to trust
      her. She might surrender to any mad impulse that stirred her fancy. So he
      called up Burlingame. Kitty's chief, and together they manufactured an
      assignment that was always a pleasant recollection to Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, Cutty summoned Professor Billy Ryan to the wire, argued and cajoled
      for ten minutes, and won his point. He was always dealing in futures&mdash;banking
      his favours here and there and drawing checks against them when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he tackled his men and issued orders suspending operations
      temporarily. He was asked what they should do in case Karlov came out into
      the open. He answered in such an event not to molest him but to watch and
      take note of those with whom he associated. There were big things in the
      air, and only he himself had hold of all the threads. He relayed this
      information to the actual chief of the local service, from whom he had
      borrowed his men. There was no protest. Green spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarter to nine he and Kitty entered a subway car and found a corner to
      themselves, while Karlov's agent was content with a strap in the crowded
      end of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karlov for once had outthought Cutty. He had withdrawn his watchers,
      confident that after a day or so his unknown opponent would withdraw his.
      During the lull Karlov matured his plans, then resumed operations,
      calculating that he would have some forty-odd hours' leeway.
    </p>
    <p>
      His agent was clever. He had followed Kitty from Eightieth Street to the
      Knickerbocker Hotel. There he had lost her. He had loitered on the
      sidewalk until midnight, and was then convinced that the girl had slipped
      by. So he had returned to Eightieth Street; but as late as five in the
      morning she had not returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      This agent had followed the banker after his visit to Kitty. He had
      watched the banker's house, seen Cutty arrive and depart. Taking a chance
      shot in the dark, he had followed Cutty to the office building, learned
      that Cutty was the owner and lived in the loft. As Kitty had not returned
      home by five he proceeded to take a second chance shot in the dark,
      stationing himself across the street from the entrance to the office
      building, thereby solving the riddle uppermost in Karlov's mind. He had
      found the man in the dress suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cutty, I'm sorry I was such a booby last night. But it was the best thing
      that could have happened. The pentupness of it was simply killing me. I
      hadn't any one to come to but you&mdash;any one who would understand. I
      don't know of any man who has a better right to kiss me. I know. You were
      just trying to buck me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clitter-clatter! Clitter-clatter! Cutty stared hard at the cement floor.
      Marry her, settle a sum on her, and give her her freedom. Molly's girl.
      Give her a chance to play. He turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, do you trust me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all the foolish questions!&rdquo; She pressed his arm. &ldquo;Why shouldn't I
      trust you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you marry me? Wait! Let me make clear to you what I have in mind.
      I'm all alone. I loved your mother. It breaks my heart that while I have
      everything in the way of luxuries you have nothing. I can't settle a sum
      on you&mdash;an income. The world wouldn't understand. Your friends would
      be asking questions among themselves. This telegram from Washington means
      but one thing: that in a few weeks I shall be on my way to the East. I
      shall be mighty unhappy if I have to go leaving you in the rut. This is my
      idea: marry me an hour or so before the ship sails. I will leave you a
      comfortable income. Lord knows how long I shall be gone. Well, I won't
      write. After a year you can regain your freedom on the grounds of
      desertion. Simple as falling off a log. It's the one logical way I can
      help you. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Station after station flashed by. Kitty continued stare through the window
      across the way, by and by she turned her face toward him, her eyes shining
      with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cutty, there is going to be a nice place in heaven for you some day. I
      understand. I believe Mother understands, too. Am I selfish? I can't say
      No to you and I can't say Yes. Yet I should be a liar if I did not say
      that everything in me leaps toward the idea. It is both hateful and
      fascinating. Common sense says Yes; and something else in me says No. I
      like dainty things, dainty surroundings. I want to travel, to see
      something of the world. I once thought I had creative genius, but I might
      as well face the fact that I haven't. Only by accident will I ever earn
      more than I'm earning now. In a few years I'll grow old suddenly. You know
      what the newspaper game does to women. The rush and hurry of it, the
      excitements, the ceaseless change. It is a furnace, and women shrivel up
      in it quicker than men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There won't be any nonsense, Kitty. An hour before I go aboard my ship.
      I'll go back to the job the happiest of men. Molly's girl taken care of!
      Just before your father died I promised him I'd keep an eye on you. I
      never forgot, but conditions made it impossible. The apartment will be
      yours as long as you need it. Kuroki, of course, goes with me. It's merely
      going by convention on the blind side. To leave you something in my will
      wouldn't serve at all, I'm a tough old codger and may be marked down for a
      hale old ninety. All I want is to make you happy and carefree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cutty, I'd like to curl up in some corner and cry, gratefully. I didn't
      know there were such men. I just don't know what to do. It isn't as if you
      were asking me to be your wife. And as you say, I can't accept money.
      There is a pride in me that rejects the whole thing; but it may be the
      same fool pride that has cut away my friends. I ought to fall on your neck
      with joy: and here I am trying to look round corners! You are my father's
      friend, my mother's, mine. Why shouldn't I accept the proposition? You are
      alone, too. You have a perfect right to do as you please with your money,
      and I have an equally perfect right to accept your gifts. We are all
      afraid of the world, aren't we? That's probably at the bottom of my
      doddering. Cutty, what is love?&rdquo; she broke off, whimsically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking into mirrors and hunting for specks,&rdquo; he answered, readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I. Before I went round to the stage entrance to take your mother
      out to supper I used to preen an hour before the mirror. My collar, my
      cravat, my hair, the nap on my stovepipe, my gloves&mdash;terrible things!
      And what happened? Your dad, dressed in his office clothes, came along
      like a cyclone, walked all over my toes, and swooped up your mother right
      from under my nose. Now just look the proposition over from all angles.
      Think of yourself; let the old world go hang. They'll call it alimony. In
      a year or so you'll be free; and some chap like Tommy Conover will come
      along, and bang! You'll know all about love. Here's old Brooklyn Bridge.
      I'll see you to the elevator. All nonsense that you should have the least
      hesitance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen minutes later he was striding along Park Row. By the swing of his
      stride any onlooker would have believed that Cutty was in a hurry to
      arrive somewhere. Instead, one was only walking. Suddenly he stopped in
      the middle of the sidewalk with the two currents of pedestrians flowing on
      each side of him, as a man might stop who saw some wonderful cloud effect.
      But there was nothing ecstatical in his expression; on the contrary, there
      was a species of bewildered terror. The psychology of all his recent
      actions had in a flash become vividly clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unbelievable catastrophe had overtaken him. He loved Kitty, loved her
      with an intense, shielding passion, quite unlike that which he had given
      her mother. Such a thing could happen! He offered not the least combat;
      the revelation was too smashing to admit of any doubt. It was not a
      recrudescence of his love for Molly, stirred into action by the
      association with Molly's daughter. He wanted Kitty for himself, wanted her
      with every fibre in his body, fiercely. And never could he tell her&mdash;now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tragic irony of it all numbed him. Fate hadn't played the game fairly.
      He was fifty-two, on the far side of the plateau, near sunset. It wasn't a
      square deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he stood there on the sidewalk, like a rock in the middle of a
      turbulent stream, rejecting selfish thoughts. Marry Kitty, and tell her
      the truth afterward. He knew the blood of her&mdash;loyalest of the loyal.
      He could if he chose play that sort of game&mdash;cheat her. He could not
      withdraw his proposition. If she accepted it he would have to carry it
      through. Cheat her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kitty hung up her hat and coat. She did not pat her hair or tuck in the
      loose ends before the mirror&mdash;a custom as invariable as sunrise. The
      coat tree stood at the right of the single window, and out of this window
      Kitty stared solemnly, at everything and at nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burlingame eyed her seriously. Cutty had given him a glimmer of the tale&mdash;enough
      to make known to him that this pretty, sensible girl, though no fault of
      her own, was in the shadow of some actual if unknown danger. And Cutty
      wanted her out of town for a few days. Burlingame had intended sending
      Kitty out of town on an assignment during Easter week. An exchange of
      telegrams that morning had closed the gap in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you might say 'Good morning.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Burly!&rdquo; In newspaper offices you belong at once or you
      never belong; and to belong is to have your name sheared to as few
      syllables as possible. You are formal only to the city editor, the
      managing editor, and the auditor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been set in the middle of a fairy story,&rdquo; said Kitty, &ldquo;and I'm
      wondering if it's worth the trouble to try to find a way out. A Knight of
      the Round Table, a prince of chivalry. What would you say if you saw one
      in spats and a black derby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered Burlingame, &ldquo;I suppose I'd consider July first as the best
      thing that could happen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty laughed; and that was what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had that old rogue been doing now&mdash;offering Kitty his
      eighteen-story office building?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's odd, isn't it, that I shouldn't possess a little histrionic ability.
      You'd think it would be in my blood to act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, Kitty; only not to mimic. You're an actress, but the Big Dramatist
      writes your business for you. Now, I've got some fairly good news for you.
      An assignment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work! What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to send you on a visit to the most charming movie queen in the
      business. She is going to return to Broadway this autumn, and she has a
      trunkful of plays to read. I have found your judgment ace-high. Mornings
      you will read with her; afternoons you will visit. She remembers your
      mother, who was the best comedienne of her day. So she will be quite as
      interested in you as you are in her. I want you to note her ways, how she
      amuses herself, eats, exercises. I want you to note the contents of her
      beautiful home; if she likes dogs or cats or horses. You will take a
      camera and get half a dozen good pictures, and a page yarn for Easter
      Sunday. Stay as long as she wants you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burlingame jerked his thumb toward a photograph on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! This will be the most scrumptious event in my life. I'm wild about
      her! But I haven't any clothes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burlingame waved his hands. &ldquo;I knew I'd hear that yodel. Eve didn't have
      anything to speak of, but she travelled a lot. Truth is, Kitty, you'd
      better dress in monotones. She might wake up to the fact that you're a
      mighty pretty young woman and suddenly become temperamental. She has a
      husband round the lot somewhere. Make him think his wife is a lucky woman.
      Here's all the dope&mdash;introduction, expenses, and tickets. Train
      leaves at two-fifty. Run along home and pack. Remember, I want a page
      yarn. No flapdoodle or mush; straight stuff. She doesn't need any
      advertising. If you go at it right you two will react upon each other as a
      tonic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty realized that this little junket was the very thing she needed&mdash;open
      spaces, long walks in which to think out her problem. She hurried home and
      spent the morning packing. When this heartrending business was over she
      summoned Tony Bernini.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going out of town, Mr. Bernini. I may be gone a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Miss Conover.&rdquo; Bernini hid a smile. He knew all about this
      trip, having been advised by Cutty over the wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I being followed any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that we know of. Still, you never can tell. What's your destination?&rdquo;
       Kitty told him. &ldquo;Better not go by train. I can get a fast roadster and run
      you out in a couple of hours. Right after lunch you go to the boss's
      garage and wait for me. I'll take care of your grips and camera. I'll
      follow on your heels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody would consider that Karlov was after me instead of Hawksley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernini smiled. &ldquo;Miss Conover, the moment Karlov puts his hands on you the
      whole game goes blooey. That's the plain fact. There is death in this
      game. These madmen expect to blow up the United States on May first. We
      are easing them along because we want the top men in our net. But if
      Karlov takes it into his head to get you, and succeeds, he'll have a
      stranglehold on the whole local service; because we'd have to make great
      concessions to free you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why wasn't I told this at the start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were told, indirectly. We did not care to frighten you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not frightened,&rdquo; said Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope. But we wish to the Lord you were, Miss Conover. When you want to
      come home, wire me and I'll motor out for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another fragment. Karlov's agent sought his chief and found him in the
      cellar of the old house, sinisterly engaged. The wall bench was littered
      with paraphernalia well known to certain chemists. Had the New York bomb
      squad known of the existence of this den, the short hair on their necks
      would have risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; greeted Karlov, moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found the man in the dress suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He and the Conover girl left that office building together this morning,
      and I followed them to Park Row. This man uses the loft of the building
      for his home. No elevator goes up unless you have credentials. Our man is
      hiding there, Boris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Karlov dry-washed his hands. &ldquo;We'll send him one of the samples if we fail
      in regard to the girl. You say she arrives daily at the newspaper office
      about nine and leaves between five and six?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every day but Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news. Two bolts; one or the other will go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About the same time in Cutty's apartment rather an amusing comedy took
      place. Professor Ryan, late physical instructor at one of the aviation
      camps, stood Hawksley in front of him and ran his hard hands over the
      young man's body. Miss Frances stood at one side, her arms folded, her
      expression skeptical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin' the matter with you, Bo, but the crack on the conk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right-o!&rdquo; agreed Hawksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lemme see your hands. Humph. Soft. Now stand on that threshold. That's
      it. Walk t' the' end o' the hall an' back. Step lively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; began Miss Frances in protest. This was cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm the doctor, miss,&rdquo; interrupted Ryan, crisply. &ldquo;If he falls down he
      goes t' bed, an' you stay. If he makes it, he follows my instructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Hawksley returned to the starting line the walls rocked, there were
      two or three blinding stabs of pain; but he faced this unusual Irishman
      with never a hint of the torture. A wild longing to be gone from this
      kindly prison&mdash;to get away from the thought of the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Ryan. &ldquo;Now toddle back t' bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep. Goin' t' give you a rub that'll start all your machinery workin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Docilely Hawksley obeyed. He wasn't going to let them know, but that bed
      was going to be tolerably welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Miss Frances. &ldquo;I don't see how he did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said the ex-pugilist. &ldquo;I told him to. Either he was a false alarm,
      or he'd attempt the job even if he fell down. The hull thing is this: Make
      a guy wanta get well an' he'll get well. If he's got any pride, dig it up.
      Go after 'em. He hasn't lost any blood. No serious body wound. A crack on
      the conk. It mighta killed him. It didn't. He didn't wabble an' fall down.
      So my dope is right. Drop in in a few days an' I'll show yuh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Frances held out her hand. &ldquo;You've handled men,&rdquo; she said, with
      reluctant admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, boy!&mdash;millions of 'em, an' each guy different. Believe me! Make
      'em wanta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty attended his conferences. He learned immediately that he was booked
      to sail the first week in May. His itinerary began at Piraeus, in Greece,
      and might end in Vladivostok. But they detained him in Washington overtime
      because he was a fount of information the departments found it necessary
      to draw upon constantly. The political and commercial aspects of the
      polyglot peoples, what they wanted, what they expected, what they needed;
      racial enmities. The bugaboo of the undesirable alien was no longer
      bothering official heads in Washington. Stringent immigration laws were in
      the making. What they wanted to know was an American's point of view,
      based upon long and intimate associations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington reminded him of nothing so much as a big sheep dog. The
      hazardous day was over; the wolves had been driven off and the sheep into
      the fold; and now the valiant guardian was turning round and round and
      round preparatory to lying down to sleep. For Washington would go to sleep
      again, naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often it occurred to him what a remarkable piece of machinery the human
      brain was. He could dig up all this dry information with the precise
      accuracy of an economist, all the while his actual thoughts upon Kitty.
      His nights were nightmares. And all this unhappiness because he had been
      touched with the lust for loot. Fundamentally, this catastrophe could be
      laid to the drums of jeopardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alluring possibility of finding those damnable green stones&mdash;the
      unsuspected kink in his moral rectitude&mdash;had tumbled him into this
      pit. Had not Kitty pronounced the name Stefani Gregor&mdash;in his mind
      always linked with the emeralds&mdash;he would have summoned an ambulance
      and had Hawksley carried off, despite Kitty's protests; and perhaps he
      would have seen her but two or three times before sailing, seen her in
      conventional and unemotional parts. At any rate, there would have been
      none of this peculiar intimacy&mdash;Kitty coming to him in tears, opening
      her young heart to him and discovering all its loneliness. If she loved
      some chap it would not be so hard, the temptation would not be so keen&mdash;to
      cheat her. Marry her, and then tell her. This dogged his thoughts like a
      murderer's deed, terrible in the watches of the night. Marry her, and then
      tell her. Cheat her. Break her heart and break his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty-two. Never before had he thought old. His splendid health and
      vigorous mentality were the results of thinking young. But now he heard
      the avalanche stirring, the whispering slither of the first pebbles. He
      would grow old swiftly, thunderously. Kitty's youth would shore up the
      debacle, suspend it indefinitely. Marry her, cheat her, and stay young.
      Green stones, accursed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty's days were pleasant enough, but her nights were sieges. One evening
      someone put Elman's rendition of Schubert's &ldquo;Ave Maria&rdquo; on the phonograph.
      Long after it was over she sat motionless in her chair. Echoes. The
      Tschaikowsky waltz. She got up suddenly, excused herself, and went to her
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six days, and her problem was still unsolved. Something in her&mdash;she
      could not define it, she could not reach it, it defied analysis&mdash;something,
      then, revolted at the idea of marrying Cutty, divorcing him, and living on
      his money. There was a touch of horror in the suggestion. It was tearing
      her to pieces, this hidden repellence. And yet this occult objection was
      so utterly absurd. If he died and left her a legacy she would accept it
      gratefully enough. Cutty's plan was only a method of circumventing this
      indefinite wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comforts, the good things of life, amusements&mdash;simply by nodding her
      head. Why not? It wasn't as if Cutty was asking her to be his wife; he
      wasn't. Just wanted to dodge convention, and give her freedom and
      happiness. He was only giving her a mite out of his income. Because he had
      loved her mother; because, but for an accident of chance, she, Kitty,
      might have been his daughter. Why, then, this persistent and unaccountable
      revulsion? Why should she hesitate? The ancient female fear of the trap?
      That could not be it. For a more honourable, a more lovable man did not
      walk the earth. Brave, strong, handsome, whimsical&mdash;why, Cutty was a
      catch!
    </p>
    <p>
      Comfy. Never any of that inherent doubt of man when she was with him.
      Absolute trust. An evil thought had entered her head; fate had made it
      honourably possible. And still this mysterious repellence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romance? She was not surrendering her right to that. What was a year out
      of her life if afterward she would be in comfortable circumstances, free
      to love where she willed? She wasn't cheating herself or Cutty: she was
      cheating convention, a flimsy thing at best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Windows. We carry our troubles to our windows; through windows we see the
      stars. We cannot visualize God, but we can see His stars pinned to the
      immeasurable spaces. So Kitty sought her window and added her question to
      the countless millions forlornly wandering about up there, and finding no
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she would return to New York on the morrow. She would not summon
      Bernini as she had promised. She would go back by train, alone,
      unhampered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in his cellar Boris Karlov spun his web for her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hawksley heard the lift door close, and he knew that at last he was alone.
      He flung out his arms, ecstatically. Free! He would see no more of that
      nagging beggar Ryan until tomorrow. Free to put into execution the idea
      that had been bubbling all day long in his head, like a fine champagne,
      firing his blood with reckless whimsicality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quietly he stole down the corridor. Through a crack in the kitchen door he
      saw Kuroki's back, the attitude of which was satisfying. It signified that
      the Jap was pegging away at his endless studies and that only the banging
      of the gong would rouse him. The way was as broad and clear as a street at
      dawn. Not that Kuroki mattered; only so long as he did not know, so much
      the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      With careful step Hawksley manoeuvred his retreat so that it brought him
      to Cutty's bedroom door. The door was unlocked. He entered the room. What
      a lark! They would hide his own clothes; so much the worse for the old
      beggar's wardrobe. Street clothes. Presently he found a dark suit,
      commendable not so much for its style as for the fact that it was the
      nearest fit he could find. He had to roll up the trouser hems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hats. Chuckling like a boy rummaging a jam closet, he rifled the shelves
      and pulled down a black derby of an unknown vintage. Large; but a runner
      of folded paper reduced the size. As he pressed the relic firmly down on
      his head he winced. A stab over his eyes. He waited doubtfully; but there
      was no recurrence. Fit as a fiddle. Of course he could not stoop without a
      flash of vertigo; but on his feet he was top-hole. He was gaining every
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luck. He might have come out of it with the blank mind of a newborn babe;
      and here he was, keen to resume his adventures. Luck. They had not stopped
      to see if he was actually dead. Some passer-by in the hall had probably
      alarmed them. That handkerchief had carried him round the brink. Perhaps
      Fate intended letting him get through&mdash;written on his pass an
      extension of his leave of absence. Or she had some new torture in reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for a stout walking stick. He selected a blackthorn, twirled it,
      saluted, and posed before the mirror. Not so bally rotten. He would pass.
      Next, he remembered that there were some flowers in the dining room&mdash;window
      boxes with scarlet geraniums. He broke off a sprig and drew it through his
      buttonhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside there was a cold, pale April sky, presaging wind and rain.
      Unimportant. He was going down into the streets for an hour or so. The
      colour and action of a crowded street; the lure was irresistible. Who
      would dare touch him in the crowd? These rooms had suddenly become
      intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned against the side of the window. Roofs, thousands of them, flat,
      domed, pinnacled; and somewhere under one of these roofs Stefani Gregor
      was eating his heart out. It did not matter that this queer old eagle whom
      everybody called Cutty had promised to bring Stefani home. It might be too
      late. Stefani was old, highly strung. Who knew what infernal lies Karlov
      had told him? Stefani could stand up under physical torture; but to tear
      at his soul, to twist and rend his spirit!
    </p>
    <p>
      The bubble in the champagne died down&mdash;as it always will if one
      permits it to stand. He felt the old mood seep through the dikes of his
      gayety. Alone. A familiar face&mdash;he would have dropped on his knees
      and thanked God for the sight of a familiar face. These people, kindly as
      they were&mdash;what were they but strangers? Yesterday he had not known
      them; to-morrow he would leave them behind forever. All at once the
      mystery of this bubbling idea was bared: he was going to risk his life in
      the streets in the vague hope of seeing some face he had known in the days
      before the world had gone drunk on blood. One familiar face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he would never forget&mdash;at any rate, not the girl whose
      courage had made possible this hour. Those chaps, scared off temporarily,
      might have returned. What had become of her? He was always seeing her
      lovely face in the shadows, now tender, now resolute, now mocking.
      Doubtless he thought of her constantly because his freedom of action was
      limited. He hadn't diversion enough. Books and fiddling, these carried him
      but halfway through the boredom. Where was she? Daily he had called her by
      telephone; no answer. The Jap shook his head; the slangy boy in the lift
      shook his.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a thoroughbred, even if she had been born of middle-class
      parentage. He laughed bitterly. Middle class. A homeless, countryless
      derelict, and he had the impudence to revert to comparisons that no longer
      existed in this topsy-turvy old world. He was an upstart. The final
      curtain had dropped between him and his world, and he was still thinking
      in the ancient make-up. Middle class! He was no better than a troglodyte,
      set down in a new wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the curtain rings slither on the pole. Believing the intruder to
      be Kuroki he turned belligerently. And there she stood&mdash;the girl
      herself! The poise of her reminded him of the Winged Victory in the
      Louvre. Where there had been a cup of champagne in his veins circumstance
      now poured a magnum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened? Where are you going in those clothes?&rdquo; demanded Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am running away&mdash;for an hour or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must not! The risks&mdash;after all the trouble we've had to help
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be perfectly safe, for you are going with me. Aren't you my
      guardian angel? Well, rather! The two of us&mdash;people, lights, shop
      windows! Perfectly splendiferous! Honestly, now, where's the harm?&rdquo; He
      approached her rapidly as he spoke, and before the spell of him could be
      shaken off Kitty found her hands imprisoned in his. &ldquo;Please! I've been so
      damnably bored. The two of us in the streets, among the crowds! No one
      will dare touch us. Can't you see? And then&mdash;I say, this is ripping!&mdash;we'll
      have dinner together here. I will play for you on the old Amati. Please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fire of him communicated to the combustibles in Kitty's soul. A wild,
      reckless irony besieged her. This adventure would be exactly what she
      needed; it would sweep clear the fog separating one side of her brain from
      the other. For it was plain enough that part of her brain refused to
      cooperate with the other. A break in the trend of thought: she might
      succeed in getting hold of the puzzle if she could drop it absolutely for
      a little while and then pick it up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not gone home. She had not notified Bernini. She had checked her
      luggage in the station parcel room and come directly here. For what? To
      let the sense of luxury overcome the hidden repugnance of the idea of
      marrying Cutty, divorcing him, and living on his money. To put herself in
      the way of visible temptation. What fretted her so, what was wearing her
      down to the point of fatigue, was the patent imbecility of her reluctance.
      There would have been some sense of it if Cutty had proposed a real
      marriage. All she had to do was mumble a few words, sign her name to a
      document, live out West for a few months, and be in comfortable
      circumstances all the rest of her life. And she doddered!
    </p>
    <p>
      She would run the streets with Johnny Two-Hawks, return, and dine with
      him. Who cared? Proper or improper, whose business was it but Kitty
      Conover's? Danger? That was the peculiar attraction. She wanted to rush
      into danger, some tense excitement the strain of which would lift her out
      of her mood. A recurrent touch of the wild impulsiveness of her childhood.
      Hadn't she sometimes flown out into thunderstorms, after merited
      punishment, to punish the mother whom thunder terrorized? And now she was
      going to rush into unknown danger to punish Fate&mdash;like a silly child!
      Nevertheless, she would go into the streets with Johnny Two-Hawks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you strong enough to venture on the streets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rot! Dash it all, I'm no mollycoddle! All nonsense to keep me pinned in
      like this. Will you go with me&mdash;be my guide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; She shot out the word and crossed the Rubicon before reason could
      begin to lecture. Besides, wasn't reason treating her shabbily in
      withholding the key to the riddle? &ldquo;Johnny Two-Hawks, I will go as far as
      Harlem if you want me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnny Two-Hawks!&rdquo; He laughed joyously, then kissed her hands. But he had
      to pay for this bending&mdash;a stab that filled his eyes with flying
      sparks. He must remember, once out of doors, not to stoop quickly. &ldquo;I say,
      you're the jolliest girl I ever met! Just the two of us, what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way you speak English is wonderful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple enough to explain. Had an English nurse from the beginning. Spoke
      English and Italian before I spoke Russian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized the wooden mallet and beat the Burmese gong&mdash;a flat piece
      of brass cut in the shape of a bell. The clear, whirring vibrations filled
      the room. Long before these spent themselves Kuroki appeared on the
      threshold. He bobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kuroki, Miss Conover is dining here with me to-night. Seven o'clock
      sharp. The best you have in the larder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sair. You are going out, sair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a bit of fresh air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am going with him, Kuroki,&rdquo; said Kitty. Kuroki bobbed again.
      &ldquo;Dinner at seven, sair.&rdquo; Another bob, and he returned to the kitchen,
      smiling. The girl was free to come and go, of course, but the ancient
      enemy of Nippon would not pass the elevator door. Let him find that out
      for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the elevator arrived the boy did not open the door. He noted the
      derby on Hawksley's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can take you down, Miss Conover, but I cannot take Mr. Hawksley. When
      the boss gives me an order I obey it&mdash;if I possibly can. On the day
      the boss tells me you can go strolling, I'll give you the key to the city.
      Until then, nix! No use arguing, Mr. Hawksley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan't argue,&rdquo; replied Hawksley, meekly. &ldquo;I am really a prisoner,
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your own good, sir. Do you wish to go down, Miss Conover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy swung the lever, and the car dropped from sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; said Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley smiled and laid a finger on his lips. &ldquo;I wanted to know,&rdquo; he
      whispered. &ldquo;There's another way down from this Matterhorn. Come with me.
      Off the living room is a storeroom. I found the key in the lock the other
      day and investigated. I still have the key. Now, then, there's a door that
      gives to the main loft. At the other end is the stairhead. There is a door
      at the foot of the first flight down. We can jolly well leave this way,
      but we shall have to return by the lift. That bally young ruffian can't
      refuse to carry us up, y' know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty laughed. &ldquo;This is going to be fun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They groped their way through the dim loft&mdash;for it was growing dark
      outside&mdash;and made the stairhead. The door to the seventeenth floor
      opened, and they stepped forth into the lighted hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; asked Kitty, bubbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The floor below, and one of the other lifts, what?&rdquo; Twenty minutes later
      the two of them, arm in arm, turned into Broadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, sir,&rdquo; began Kitty with a gesture, &ldquo;is Broadway&mdash;America's
      backyard in the daytime and Ali Baba's cave at night. The way of the
      gilded youth; the funnel for papa's money; the chorus lady; the starting
      point of the high cost of living. We New Yorkers despise it because we
      can't afford it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lights!&rdquo; gasped Hawksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wreckers' lights. Behold! Yonder is a highly nutritious whisky blinking
      its bloomin' farewell. Do you chew gum? Even if you don't, in a few
      minutes I'll give you a cud for thought. Chewing gum was invented by a man
      with a talkative wife. He missed the physiological point, however, that a
      body can chew and talk at the same time. Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went on uptown, Hawksley highly amused, exhilarated, but frequently
      puzzled. The pungent irony of her observations conveyed to him that under
      this gayety was a current of extreme bitterness. &ldquo;I say, are all American
      girls like you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens, no! Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I never met one like you before. Rather stilted&mdash;on their
      good behaviour, I fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I interest you because I'm not on my good behaviour?&rdquo; Kitty whipped
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are as God made you&mdash;without camouflage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor innocent young man! I'm nothing but camouflage to-night. Why are
      you risking your life in the street? Why am I sharing that risk? Because
      we both feel bound and are blindly trying to break through. What do you
      know about me? Nothing. What do I know about you? Nothing. But what do we
      care? Come on, come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tumpitum&mdash;tump! tumpitum&mdash;tump! drummed the Elevated. Kitty
      laughed. The tocsin! Always something happened when she heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pearls!&rdquo; she cried, dragging him toward a jeweller's window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said, holding back. &ldquo;I hate&mdash;jewels! How I hate them!&rdquo; He
      broke away from her and hurried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had to run after him. Had she hesitated they might have become
      separated. Hated jewels? No, no! There should be no questions, verbal or
      mental, this night. She presently forced him to slow down. &ldquo;Not so fast!
      We must never become separated,&rdquo; she warned. &ldquo;Our safety&mdash;such as it
      is&mdash;lies in being together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm an ass. Perhaps my head is ratty without my realizing it. I fancy I'm
      like a dog that's been kicked; I'm trying to run away from the pain.
      What's this tomb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Metropolitan Opera House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they were passing a thin, wailing sound came to the ears of both.
      Seated with his back to the wall was a blind fiddler with a tin cup
      strapped to a knee. He was out of bounds; he had no right on Broadway; but
      he possessed a singular advantage over the law. He could not be forced to
      move on without his guide&mdash;if he were honestly blind. Hundreds of
      people were passing; but the fiddler's &ldquo;Last Rose of Summer&rdquo; wasn't worth
      a cent. His cup was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor thing!&rdquo; said Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Hawksley approached the fiddler, exchanged a few words with him,
      and the blind man surrendered his fiddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your hat!&rdquo; cried Kitty, delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carefully Hawksley pried loose his derby and handed it to Kitty. No stab
      of pain; something to find that out. He turned the instrument, tucked it
      under his chin and began &ldquo;Traumerei.&rdquo; Kitty, smiling, extended the hat.
      Just the sort of interlude to make the adventure memorable. She knew this
      thoroughfare. Shortly there would be a crowd, and the fiddler's cup would
      overflow&mdash;that is, if the police did not interfere too soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the owner of the wretched fiddle, he raised his head, his mouth
      opened. Up there, somewhere, a door to heaven had opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      True to her expectations a crowd slowly gathered. The beauty of the girl
      and the dark, handsome face of the musician, his picturesque bare head,
      were sufficient for these cynical passers-by. They understood. Operatic
      celebrities, having a little fun on their own. So quarters and dimes and
      nickels began to patter into Cutty's ancient derby hat. Broadway will
      always contribute generously toward a novelty of this order. Famous names
      were tossed about in undertones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entered then the enemy of the proletariat. Kitty, being a New Yorker born,
      had had her weather eye roving. The brass-buttoned minion of the law was
      always around when a bit of innocent fun was going on. As the policeman
      reached the inner rim of the audience the last notes of Handel's &ldquo;Largo&rdquo;
       were fading on the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this?&rdquo; demanded the policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all over, sir,&rdquo; answered Kitty, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't have this on Broadway, miss. Obstruction.&rdquo; He could not speak
      gruffly in the face of such beauty&mdash;especially with a Broadway crowd
      at his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all over. Just let me put this money in the blind man's cup.&rdquo; Kitty
      poured her coins into the receptacle. At the same time Hawksley laid the
      fiddle in the blind man's lap. Then he turned to Kitty and boomed a long
      Russian phrase at her. Her quick wit caught the intent. &ldquo;You see, he
      doesn't understand that this cannot be done in New York. I couldn't
      explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, miss; but don't do it again.&rdquo; The policeman grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And please don't be harsh with the blind man. Just tell him he mustn't
      play on Broadway again. Thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She linked her arm in Hawksley's, and they went on; and the crowd
      dissolved; only the policeman and the blind man remained, the one
      contemplating his duty and the other his vision of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lark!&rdquo; exclaimed Hawksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you asking me for your hat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was telling the bobby to go to the devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed like children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;March hares!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. April fools! Good heavens, the time! Twenty minutes to seven. Our
      dinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll take a taxi.... Dash it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bally copper in my pockets!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I left my handbag on the sideboard! We'll have to walk. If we hurry
      we can just about make it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, there lay in wait for them&mdash;this pair of April fools&mdash;a
      taxicab. It stood snugly against the curb opposite the entrance to Cutty's
      apartment. The door was slightly ajar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver watched the south corner; the three men inside never took their
      gaze off the north corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, I say, hasn't this been a jolly lark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we had known we could have borrowed a dollar from the blind man; he'd
      never have missed it.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Champagne in the glass is a beautiful thing to see. So is water, the
      morning after. That is the fault with frolic; there is always an
      inescapable rebound. The most violent love drops into humdrum tolerance. A
      pessimist is only a poor devil who has anticipated the inevitable; he has
      his headache at the start. Mental champagnes have their aftermaths even as
      the juice of the grape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley and Kitty, hurrying back, began to taste lees. They began to see
      things, too&mdash;menace in every loiterer, threat in every alley. They
      had had a glorious lark; somewhere beyond would be the piper with an
      appalling bill. They exaggerated the dangers, multiplied them; perhaps
      wisely. There would be no let-down in their vigilance until they reached
      haven. But this state of mind they covered with smiling masks, banter,
      bursts of laughter, and flashes of wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both genuinely frightened, but with unselfish fear. Kitty's fear
      was not for herself but for Johnny Two-Hawks. If anything happened the
      blame would rightly be hers. With that head he wasn't strictly accountable
      for what he did; she was. A firm negative on her part and he would never
      have left the apartment. And his fear was wholly for this astonishing
      girl. He had recklessly thrust her into grave danger. Who knew, better
      than he, the implacable hate of the men who sought to kill him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, his strength was leaving him. There was an alarming weakness in
      his legs, purely physical. He had overdone, and if need rose he would not
      be able to protect her. Damnable fool! But she had known. That was the odd
      phase of it. She hadn't come blindly. What mood had urged her to share the
      danger along with the lark? Somehow, she was always just beyond his reach,
      this girl. He would never forget that fan popping out of the pistol, the
      egg burning in the pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apartment was only three blocks away when Kitty decided to drop her
      mask. &ldquo;I'd give a good deal to see a policeman. They are never around when
      you really want them. Johnny Two-Hawks, I'm a little fool! You wouldn't
      have left the apartment but for me. Will you forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I who should ask forgiveness. I say, how much farther is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only about two blocks; but they may be long ones. Let's step into this
      doorway for a moment. I see a taxicab. It looks to be standing opposite
      the building. Don't like it. Suppose we watch it for a few minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley was grateful for the respite; and together they stared at the
      unwinking red eye of the tail light. But no man approached the cab or left
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I've hit upon a plan,&rdquo; said Kitty. &ldquo;Certainly we have not been
      followed. In that event they would have had a dozen chances. If someone
      saw us leave together, naturally they will expect us to return together.
      We'll walk to the corner of our block, then turn east; but I shall remain
      just out of sight while you will go round the block. Fifteen minutes
      should carry you to the south corner. I'll be on watch for you. The moment
      you turn I'll walk toward you. It will give us a bit of a handicap in case
      that taxi is a menace. If any one appears, run for it. Where's the cane
      you had?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a jolly ass I am! I remember now. I left the stick against the wall
      of the opera house. Blockhead! With a stick, now!... I'm hopeless!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. Let's start. That taxi may be perfectly honest. It's our
      guilty consciences that are peopling the shadows with goblins. What really
      bothers us is that we have broken our word to the kindliest man in all
      this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley wondered if he could walk round the block without falling down.
      He saw that he was facing a physical collapse, hastened by the knowledge
      that the safety of the girl depended largely upon himself. What he had
      accepted at the beginning as strength had been nothing more than
      exhilaration and nerve energy. There was now nothing but the latter, and
      only feeble straws at that. Oh, he would manage somehow; he jolly well had
      to; and there was a bare chance of falling in with a bobby. But run?
      Honestly, now, how the devil was a chap to run on a pair of spools?
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving at the appointed spot they separated. He waved his hand airily
      and marched off. If he fell it would be out of sight, where the girl could
      not see him. Clever chap&mdash;what? Damned rotter! For himself he did not
      care. He was weary of this game of hide and seek. But to have lured the
      girl into it! When he turned the first corner of his journey he paused and
      leaned against the wall, his eyes shut. When he opened them the sidewalk
      and the street lamps were normal again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he disappeared a new plan came to Kitty. She put it into
      execution at once, on the basis that yonder taxicab was an enemy machine.
      She left her retreat and walked boldly down the street, her eyes alert for
      the least suspicious sign. If she could make the entrance before they
      suspected the trick, she could obtain help before Johnny Two-Hawks made
      the south turn. She reached her objective, pushed through the revolving
      doors, and turned. Dimly she could see the taxi driver; but he appeared to
      be dozing on the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, one of the three men in the taxi recognized Kitty,
      but too late to intercept her. Her manoeuvre had confused him temporarily.
      And while he and his companions were debating, Kitty had time to summon
      Cutty's man from Elevator Four.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step into the car!&rdquo; he roughly ordered, after she had given him a gist of
      her suspicions. He turned off the lights, stepped out, and shut the gates
      with a furious bang. &ldquo;And stick to the corner! I'll attend to the other fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rushed into the street, his automatic ready, eyed the taxicab
      speculatively, wheeled suddenly, and ran south at a dog-trot. He rounded
      the south corner, but he did not see Hawksley anywhere. The dog-trot
      became a dead run. As he wheeled round the corner of the parallel street
      he almost bumped into Hawksley, who had a policeman in tow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Officer,&rdquo; said the man with the boy's face, &ldquo;this is Federal business.
      Aliens. Come along. There may be trouble. If there should be any shooting
      don't bother with the atmosphere. Pick out a real target.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anarchists?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the size of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Conover?&rdquo; asked Hawksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe. No thanks to you, though. I'd like to knock your block off, if you
      want to know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it! Damned little use to me,&rdquo; declared Hawksley, sagging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, what's the matter with you?&rdquo; cried the policeman, throwing his arm
      round Hawksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They nearly killed him a few days gone. A crack on the bean; but he
      wasn't satisfied. Help him along. I'll be hiking back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the taxicab was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Cutty's lieutenant opened the gate to the apartment he spoke to
      Hawksley. &ldquo;The boss is doing everything he can to put you through, sir.
      Miss Conover's wit saved you. For if you hadn't separated they'd have
      nailed you. I've been running round like a chicken with its head cut off.
      I forgot that door on the seventeenth floor. I tell you honestly, you've
      been playing with death. It wasn't fair to Miss Conover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my fault,&rdquo; volunteered Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; protested Hawksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they know where you roost now, for a fact. You've spilled the
      beans. I'm sorry I lost my temper. The devil fly away with you both!&rdquo; The
      boy laughed. &ldquo;You're game, anyhow. But darn it all, if anything had
      happened to you the boss would never have forgiven me. He's the whitest
      old scout God ever put the breath of life into. He's always doing
      something for somebody. He'd give you the block if you had the gall to ask
      for it. Play the game fifty-fifty with him and you'll land on both feet.
      And you, Miss Conover, must not come here again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you a little secret. It was the boss who sent you out of town.
      He was afraid you'd do something like this. When you are ready to go home
      you'll find Tony Bernini downstairs. Sore as a crab, too, I'll bet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be glad to go home with him,&rdquo; said Kitty, thoroughly chastened in
      spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all for to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty and Hawksley stepped out into the corridor, the problem they had
      sought to shake off reestablished in their thoughts, added too, if
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Top-hole,&rdquo; lied Hawksley. &ldquo;My word, though, I wobbled a bit going round
      that block. I almost kissed the bobby. I say, he thought I'd been tilting
      a few. But it was a lark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner is served,&rdquo; announced Kuroki at their elbows. His expression was
      coldly bland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner!&rdquo; cried Hawksley, brightening. &ldquo;What does the American soldier
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eats!&rdquo; answered Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      All tension vanished in the double laughter that followed. They approached
      dinner with something of the spirit that had induced Hawksley to fiddle
      and Kitty to pass the hat in front of the Metropolitan Opera House.
      Hawksley's recuperative powers promised well for his future. By the time
      coffee was served his head had cleared and his legs had resumed their
      normal functions of support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so infernally bored!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now?&rdquo; asked Kitty, recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy asking me that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you realize that all this is dreadfully improper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, now! Where's the harm? If ever there was a young woman capable
      of taking care of herself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't it. It's just being here alone with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not alone with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kuroki?&rdquo; Kitty shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. At my side of the table is Stefani Gregor; at yours the man who has
      befriended me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for that. I don't know of anything nicer you could say. But the
      outside world would see neither of our friends. I did not come here to see
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need of telling me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a problem&mdash;a very difficult one&mdash;to solve; and I believed
      that I might solve it if I came to these rooms. I had quite forgotten
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly, upon receiving this blunt explanation, he determined that she
      should never cease to remember him after this night. His vanity was not
      touched; it was something far more elusive. It was perhaps a recurrence of
      that inexplicable desire to hurt. Somehow he sensed the flexible steel
      behind which lay the soul of this baffling girl. He would presently find a
      chink in the armour with that old Amati.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blows on the head have few surgical comparisons. That which kills one man
      only temporarily stuns another. One man loses his identity; another
      escapes with all his faculties and suffers but trifling inconvenience. In
      Hawksley's case the blow had probably restricted some current of thought,
      and that which would have flowed normally now shot out obliquely,
      perversely. It might be that the natural perverseness of his blood,
      unchecked by the noble influence of Stefani Gregor and liberated by the
      blow, governed his thoughts in relation to Kitty. The subjugation of
      women, the old cynical warfare of sex&mdash;the dominant business of his
      rich and idle forbears, the business that had made Boris Karlov a deadly
      and implacable enemy&mdash;became paramount in his disordered brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had forgotten him! Very well. He would stir the soul of her, play with
      it, lift it to the stars and dash it down&mdash;if she had a soul.
      Beautiful, natural, alone. He became all Latin under the pressure of this
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will play for you,&rdquo; he said, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please! And then I'll go home where I belong. I'll be in the living
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he returned he found her before a window, staring at the myriad
      lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit here,&rdquo; he said, indicating the divan. &ldquo;I shall stand and walk about
      as I play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty sat down, touching the pillows, reflectively. She thought of the
      tears she had wept upon them. That sinister and cynical thought! Suddenly
      she saw light. Her problem would have been none at all if Cutty had said
      he loved her. There would have been something sublime in making him happy
      in his twilight. He had loved and lost her mother. To pay him for that! He
      was right. Those twenty-odd years&mdash;his seniority&mdash;had mellowed
      him, filled him with deep and tender understanding. To be with him was
      restful; the very thought of him now was resting. No matter how much she
      might love a younger man he would frequently torture her by unconscious
      egoism; and by the time he had mellowed, the mulled wine would be cold. If
      only Cutty had said he loved her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I play?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty raised her eyes in frank astonishment. There was a fiercely proud
      expression on Hawksley's face. It was not the man, it was the artist who
      was angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me! I was dreaming a little,&rdquo; she apologized with quick
      understanding. &ldquo;I am not quite&mdash;myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither am I. I will play something to fit your dream. But wait! When I
      play I am articulate. I can express myself&mdash;all emotions. I am what I
      play&mdash;happy, sad, gay, full of the devil. I warn you. I can speak all
      things. I can laugh at you, weep with you, despise you, love you! All in
      the touch of these strings. I warn you there is magic in this Amati. Will
      you risk it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ordinarily&mdash;had this florid outburst come from another man&mdash;Kitty
      would have laughed. It had the air of piqued vanity; but she knew that
      this was not the interpretation. On the streets he had been the most
      amusing and surprising comrade she had ever known, as merry and whimsical
      as Cutty&mdash;young and handsome&mdash;the real man. He had been real
      that night when he entered through her kitchen window, with the drums of
      jeopardy about his neck. He had been real that night she had brought him
      his wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Electric antagonism&mdash;the room seemed charged with it. The man had
      stepped aside for a moment and the great noble had taken his place. It was
      not because she had been reared in rather a theatrical atmosphere that she
      transcribed his attitude thus. She knew that he was noble. That she did
      not know his rank was of no consequence. Cutty's narrative, which she had
      pretended to believe, had set this man in the middle class. Never in this
      world. There was only one middle class out of which such a personality
      might, and often did, emerge&mdash;the American middle class. In Europe,
      never. No peasant blood, no middle-class corpuscle, stirred in this man's
      veins. The ancient boyar looked down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play!&rdquo; said Kitty. There was a smile on her lips, but there was fiery
      challenge in her slate-blue eyes. The blood of Irish kings&mdash;and what
      Irishman dares deny it?&mdash;surged into her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      We wear masks, we inherit generations of masks; and a trivial incident
      reveals the primordial which lurks in each one of us. Savages&mdash;Kitty
      with her stone hatchet and Hawksley swinging the curved blade of Hunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began one of those tempestuous compositions, brilliant and bewildering,
      that submerge the most appreciative lay mentality&mdash;because he was
      angry, a double anger that he should be angry over he knew not what&mdash;and
      broke off in the middle of the composition because Kitty sat upright,
      stonily unimpressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tschaikowsky's &ldquo;Serenade Melancolique.&rdquo; Kitty, after a few measures, laid
      aside her stone hatchet, and her body relaxed. Music! She began to absorb
      it as parched earth absorbs the tardy rain. Then came the waltz which had
      haunted her. Her face grew tenderly beautiful; and Hawksley, a true
      artist, saw that he had discovered the fifth string; and he played upon it
      with all the artistry which was naturally his and which had been given
      form by the master who had taught him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the physical exertions he relied upon nerve energy again. Nature is
      generous when we are young. No matter how much we draw against the account
      she always has a little more for us. He forgot that only an hour gone he
      had been dizzy with pain, forgot everything but the glory of the sounds he
      was evoking and their visible reaction upon this girl. The devil was not
      only in his heart, but in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had Kitty heard such music. To be played to in this manner&mdash;directly,
      with embracing tenderness, with undivided fire&mdash;would have melted the
      soul of Gobseck the money lender; and Kitty was warm-blooded, Irish,
      emotional. The fiddle called poignantly to the Irish in her. She wanted to
      go roving with this man; with her hand on his shoulder to walk in the thin
      air of high places. Through it all, however, she felt vaguely troubled;
      the instinct of the trap. The sinister and cynical idea which had
      clandestinely taken up quarters in her mind awoke and assailed her from a
      new angle, that of youth. Something in her cried out: &ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo; But
      her lips were mute, her body enchained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Hawksley laid aside the fiddle and advanced. He reached down and
      drew her up. Kitty did not resist him; she was numb with enchantment. He
      held her close for a second, then kissed her&mdash;her hair, eyes, mouth&mdash;released
      her and stepped back, a bantering smile on his lips and cold terror in his
      heart. The devil who had inspired this phase of the drama now deserted his
      victim, as he generally does in the face of superior forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty stood perfectly still for a full minute, stunned. It was that smile&mdash;frozen
      on his lips&mdash;that brought her back to intimacy with cold realities.
      Had he asked her pardon, had he shown the least repentance, she might have
      forgiven, forgotten. But knowing mankind as she did she could give but one
      interpretation to that smile&mdash;of which he was no longer conscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without anger, in quiet, level tones she said: &ldquo;I had foolishly thought
      that we two might be friends. You have made it impossible. You have also
      abused the kindly hospitality of the man who has protected you from your
      enemies. A few days ago he did me the honour to ask me to marry him. I am
      going to. I wish you no evil.&rdquo; She turned and walked from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then there was time. But he did not move. It was not until he heard
      the elevator gate crash that he was physically released from the thraldom
      of the inner revelation. Love&mdash;in the blinding flash of a
      thunderbolt! He had kissed her not because he was the son of his father,
      but because he loved her! And now he never could tell her. He must let her
      go, believing that the man she had saved from death had repaid her with
      insult. On top of all his misfortunes, his tragedies&mdash;love! There was
      a God, yes, but his name was Irony. Love! He stepped toward the divan,
      stumbled, and fell against it, his arms spread over the pillows; and in
      this position he remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while his thoughts were broken, inconclusive; he was like a man in
      the dark, groping for a door. Principally, his poor head was trying to
      solve the riddle of his never-ending misfortunes. Why? What had he done
      that these calamities should be piled upon his head? He had lived
      decently; his youth had been normal; he had played fair with men and
      women. Why make him pay for what his forbears had done? He wasn't fair
      game.
    </p>
    <p>
      He! A singular revelation cleared one corner. Kitty had spoken of a
      problem; and he, by those devil-urged kisses, had solved it for her. She
      had been doddering, and his own act had thrust her into the arms of that
      old thoroughbred. That cynical suggestion of his the other morning had
      been acted upon. God had long ago deserted him, and now the devil himself
      had taken leave. Hawksley buried his face in the pillow once made wet with
      Kitty's tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great tragedy in life lies in being too late. Hawksley had learned
      this once before; it was now being driven home again. Cutty was to find it
      out on the morrow, for he missed his train that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shuttles of the Weaver in this pattern of life were two green stones
      called the drums of jeopardy, inanimate objects, but perfect tools in the
      hands of Destiny. But for these stones Hawksley would not have tarried too
      long on a certain red night; Cutty would not now be stumbling about the
      labyrinths into which his looting instincts had thrust him; and Kitty
      Conover would have jogged along in the humdrum rut, if not happy at least
      philosophically content with her lot.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Decision is always a mental relief, hesitance a curse. Kitty, having
      shifted her burdens to the broad shoulders of Cutty, felt as she reached
      the lobby as if she had left storm and stress behind and entered calm. She
      would marry Cutty; she had published the fact, burned her bridges.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had stepped into the car, her heart full of cold fury. Now she began
      to find excuses for Hawksley's conduct. A sick brain; he was not really
      accountable for his acts. Her own folly had opened the way. Of course she
      would never see him again. Why should she? Their lives were as far apart
      as the Volga and the Hudson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernini met her in the lobby. &ldquo;I've got a cab for you, Miss Conover,&rdquo; he
      said as if nothing at all had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you Cutty's address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take me at once to a telegraph office. I have a very important
      message to send him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Miss Conover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say: 'Decision made. It is yes.' And sign it just Kitty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without being conscious of it her soul was still in the clouds, where it
      had been driven by the music of the fiddle; thus, what she assumed to be a
      normal sequence of a train of thought was only a sublime impulse. She
      would marry Cutty. More, she would be his wife, his true wife. For his
      tenderness, his generosity, his chivalry, she would pay him in kind. There
      would be no nonsense; love would not enter into the bargain; but there
      would be the fragrance of perfect understanding. That he was fifty-two and
      she was twenty-four no longer mattered. No more loneliness, no more
      genteel poverty; for such benefits she was ready to pay the score in full.
      A man she was genuinely fond of, a man she could look up to, always depend
      upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there such a thing as perfect love? She had her doubts. She reasoned
      that love was what a body decided was love, the psychological moment when
      the physical attraction became irresistible. Who could tell before the
      fact which was the true and which the false? Lived there a woman, herself
      excepted, who had not hesitated between two men&mdash;a man who had not
      doddered between two women&mdash;for better or for worse? What did the
      average woman know of the man, the average man know of the woman&mdash;until
      afterward? To stake all upon a guess!
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew Cutty. Under her own eyes he had passed through certain proving
      fires. There would be no guessing the manner of man he was. He was
      fifty-two; that is to say, the grand passion had come and gone. There
      would be mutual affection and comradeship.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, she had her dreams; but she could lay them away without any
      particular regret. She had never been touched by the fire of passion. Let
      it go. But she did know what perfect comradeship was, and she would grasp
      it and never loose her hold. Something out of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A narrow squeak, Miss Conover,&rdquo; said Berumi, breaking the long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A miss is as good as a mile,&rdquo; replied Kitty, not at all grateful for the
      interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've done everything we could to protect you. If you can't see now&mdash;why,
      the jig is up. A chain is as strong as its weakest link. And in a game
      like this a woman is always the weakest link.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're quite a philosopher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have reason to be. I'm married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I expected to laugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Conover, you're a wonder. You come through these affairs with a
      smile, when you ought to have hysterics. I'll bet a doughnut that when you
      see a mouse you go and get it a piece of cheese.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want the truth? Well, I'll tell it to you. You have all kept me on
      the outer edge of this affair, and I've been trying to find out why. I
      have the reportorial instinct, as they say. I inherited it from my father.
      You put a strange weapon in my hands, you tell me it is deadly, but you
      don't tell me which end is deadly. Do you know who this Russian is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honestly, I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Cutty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of a pair of emeralds called the drums of jeopardy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope. But I do know if you continue these stunts you'll head the whole
      game into the ditch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may set your mind at ease. I'm going to marry Cutty. I shall not go
      to the apartment again until Hawksley, as he is called, is gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well; that's good news! But let me put you wise to one fact, Miss
      Conover: you have picked some man! I'm not much of a scholar, but knowing
      him as I do I'm always wondering why they made Faith, Hope, and Charity in
      female form. But this night's work was bad business. They know where the
      Russian is now; and if the game lasts long enough they'll reach the chief,
      find out who he is; and that'll put the kibosh on his usefulness here and
      abroad. Well, here's home, and no more lecture from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry I've been so much trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we ought to have shown you which end shoots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Kitty had any doubt as to the wisdom of her decision, the cold, gloomy
      rooms of her apartment dissipated them. She wandered through the rooms,
      musing, calling back animated scenes. What would the spirit of her mother
      say? Had she doddered between Conover and Cutty? Perhaps. But she had been
      one of the happy few who had guessed right. Singular thought: her mother
      would have been happy with Cutty, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the relief of knowing what the future was going to be! She took off
      her hat and tossed it upon the table. The good things of life, and a good
      comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Food. The larder would be empty and there was her breakfast to consider.
      She passed out into the kitchen, wrote out a list of necessities, and put
      it on the dumb waiter. Now for the dishes she had so hurriedly left. She
      rolled up her sleeves, put on the apron, and fell to the task. After such
      a night&mdash;dish-washing! She laughed. It was a funny old world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauses. Perhaps she should have gone to a hotel, away from all familiar
      objects. Those flatirons intermittently pulled her eyes round. Her fancy
      played tricks with her whenever her glance touched the window. Faces
      peering in. In a burst of impatience she dropped the dish towel, hurried
      to the window, and threw it up. Black emptiness!... Cutty, crossing the
      platform with Hawksley on his shoulders. She saw that, and it comforted
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She finished her work and started for bed. But first she entered the guest
      room and turned on the lights. Olga. She had intended to ask him who Olga
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great pity. They might have been friends. The back of her hand went to
      her lips but did not touch them. She could not rub away those burning
      kisses&mdash;that is, not with the back of her hand. Vividly she saw him
      fiddling bareheaded in front of the Metropolitan Opera House. It seemed,
      though, that it had happened years ago. A great pity. The charm of that
      frolic would abide with her as long as she lived. A brave man, too. Hadn't
      he left her with a gay wave of the hand, not knowing, for want of
      strength, if he could make the detour of the block? That took courage. His
      journey halfway across the world had taken courage. Yet he could so basely
      disillusion her. It was not the kiss; it was the smile. She had seen that
      smile before, born of evil. If only he had spoken!
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavenly magic of that fiddle! It made her sad. Genius, the ability to
      play with souls, soothe, tantalize, lift up; and then to smile at her like
      that!
    </p>
    <p>
      She shut down the curtain upon these cogitations and summoned Cutty,
      visualized his handsome head, shot with gray, the humour of his smile. She
      did care for him; no doubt of that. She couldn't have sent that telegram
      else. Cutty&mdash;name of a pipe, as the Frenchmen said! All at once she
      rocked with laughter. She was going to marry a man whose given name she
      could not recall! Henry, George, John, William? For the life of her she
      could not remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with this laughter still bubbling in a softer note she got into bed,
      twisted about from side to side, from this pillow to that, the tired body
      seeking perfect relaxation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A broken melody entered her head. Sleepily she sought one channel of
      thought after another to escape; still the melody persisted. As her
      consciousness dodged hither and thither the bars and measures joined....
      She sat up, chilled, bewildered. That Tschaikowsky waltz! She could hear
      it as clearly as if Johnny Two-Hawks and the Amati were in the very room.
      She grew afraid. Of what? She did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while she sat there in bed threshing out this fear to find the grain,
      Cutty was tramping the streets of Washington, her telegram crumpled in his
      hand. From time to time he would open it and reread it under a street
      lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      To marry her and then to cheat her. It wasn't humanly possible to marry
      her and then to let her go. He thought of those warm, soft arms round his
      neck, the absolute trust of that embrace. Molly's girl. No, he could not
      do it. He would have to back down, tell her he could not put the bargain
      through, invent some other scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea had been repugnant to her. It had taken her a week to fight it
      out. It was a little beyond his reach, however, why the idea should have
      been repugnant to her. It entailed nothing beyond a bit of mummery. The
      repugnance was not due to religious training. The Conover household, as he
      recalled it, had been rather lax in that respect. Why, then, should Kitty
      have hesitated?
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of Hawksley, and swore. But for Hawksley's suggestion no muddle
      like this would have occurred. Devil take him and his infernal green
      stones!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty suddenly remembered his train. He looked at his watch and saw that
      his lower berth was well on the way to Baltimore. Always and eternally he
      was missing something.

      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not unusually, when we burn our bridges, we have in the back of our minds
      the dim hope that there may be a shallow ford somewhere. Thus, bridges
      should not be burned impulsively; there may be no ford.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of retreat pushed forward in Kitty's mind the moment she awoke;
      but she pressed it back in shame. She had given her word, and she would
      stand by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night had been a series of wild impulses. She had not sent that
      telegram to Cutty as the result of her deliberations in the country.
      Impulse; a flash, and the thing was done, her bridges burned. To crush
      Johnny Two-Hawks, fill his cup with chagrin, she had told him she was
      going to marry Cutty. That was the milk in the cocoanut. Morning has a way
      of showing up night-gold for what it is&mdash;tinsel. Kitty saw the stage
      of last night's drama dismantled. If there was a shallow ford, she would
      never lower her pride to seek it. She had told Two-Hawks, sent that wire
      to Cutty, broke the news to Bernini.
    </p>
    <p>
      But did she really want to go back? Not to know her own mind, to swing
      back and forth like a pendulum! Was it because she feared that, having
      married Cutty, she might actually fall in love with some other man later?
      She could still go through the mummery as Cutty had planned; but what
      about all the sublime generosity of the preceding night?
    </p>
    <p>
      A queer feeling pervaded her: She was a marionette, a human manikin, and
      some invisible hand was pulling the wires that made her do all these
      absurd things. Her own mind no longer controlled her actions. The
      persistence of that waltz! It had haunted her, broken into her dreams,
      awakened her out of them. Why should she be afraid? What was there to be
      afraid of in a recurring melody? She had heard a dozen famed violinists
      play it. It had never before affected her beyond a flash of emotionalism.
      Perhaps it was the romantic misfortune of the man, the mystery surrounding
      him, the menace which walled him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast. Human manikins had appetites. So she made her breakfast. Before
      leaving the kitchen she stopped at the window. The sun filled the court
      with brilliant light. The patches of rust on the fire-escape ladder, which
      was on the Gregor side of the platform, had the semblance of powdered
      gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later she was speeding downtown to the office. All through
      the day she walked, worked, talked as one in the state of trance. There
      were periods of stupefaction which at length roused Burlingame's
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, what's the matter with you? You look dazed about something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you clean a pipe?&rdquo; she countered, irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clean a pipe?&rdquo; he repeated, nearly overbalancing his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You see, I may make up my mind to marry a man who smokes a pipe,&rdquo;
       said Kitty, desperately, eager to steer Burlingame into another channel;
      &ldquo;and certainly I ought to know how to clean one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, I'm an old-timer. You can't sidetrack me like this. Something has
      happened. You say you had a great time in the country, and you come in as
      pale as the moon, like someone suffering from shell shock. Ever since
      Cutty came in here that day you've been acting oddly. You may not know it,
      but Cutty asked me to send you out of town. You've been in some kind of
      danger. What's the yarn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So big that no newspaper will ever publish it, Burly. If Cutty wants to
      tell you some day he can. I haven't the right to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he drag you into it or did you fall into it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I walked into it, as presently I shall walk out of it&mdash;all on my
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better keep your eyes open. Cutty's a stormy petrel; when he flies
      there's rough weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably what he has already told you&mdash;that he is a foreign agent of
      the Government. What do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything but one thing, and that's a problem particularly my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alien stuff, I suppose. Cutty's strong on that. Well, mind your step. The
      boys are bringing in queer scraps about something big going to happen May
      Day&mdash;no facts, just rumours. Better shoot for home the shortest route
      each night and stick round there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are certain spiritual exhilarants that nullify caution, warning the
      presence of danger. The boy with his first pay envelope, the lover who has
      just been accepted, the debutante on the way to her first ball; the
      impetus that urges us to rush in where angels fear to tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a quarter after five Kitty left the office for home, unaware that the
      attribute designated as caution had evaporated from her system. She
      proceeded toward the Subway mechanically, the result of habit. Casually
      she noted two taxicabs standing near the Subway entrance. That she noted
      them at all was due to the fact that Subway entrances were not fortuitous
      hunting grounds for taxicabs. Only the unusual would have attracted her in
      her present condition of mind. It takes time and patience to weave a good
      web&mdash;observe any spider&mdash;time in finding a suitable place for
      it; patience in the spinning. All that worried Karlov was the possibility
      of her not observing him. If he could place his taxicabs where they would
      attract her, even casually, the main difficulty would be out of the way.
      The moment she turned her head toward the cabs he would step out into
      plain view. The girl was susceptible and adventuresome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty saw a man step out of the foremost taxicab, give some instructions
      to the chauffeur, and get back into the cab, immediately to be driven off
      at moderate speed. She recognized the man at once. Never would she forget
      that squat, gorilla-like body. Karlov! Yonder, in that cab! She ran to the
      remaining cab; wherein she differed from angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that taxi going across town? Follow it and I will give you ten extra
      fare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're on, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Karlov peered through the rear window of his cab. If she had in tow a
      Federal agent the manoeuvre would fail, at a great risk to himself. But he
      would soon be able to tell whether or not she was being followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, she was not. She had returned to New York a day
      before she was expected. Her unknown downtown guardian would not turn up
      for duty until ordered by Cutty to do so. She entered the second cab with
      no definite plan in her head. Karlov, the man who wanted to kill Johnny
      Two-Hawks, the man who held Stefani Gregor a prisoner! For the present
      these facts were sufficient. &ldquo;Don't get too near,&rdquo; said Kitty through the
      speaking tube. &ldquo;Just keep the cab in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A perfectly logical compensation. She herself had set in motion the
      machinery of this amazing adventure; it was logically right that she
      should end it. Poor dear old Cutty&mdash;to fancy he could pull the wool
      over Kitty Conover's eyes! Cutty, the most honest man alive, had set his
      foot upon an unethical bypath and now found himself among nettles. To keep
      Johnny Two-Hawks prisoner in that lofty apartment while he hunted for the
      drums of jeopardy! Hadn't he said he had seen emeralds he would steal with
      half a chance? Cutty, playing at this sort of game, his conscience biting
      whichever way he turned! He had been hunting unsuccessfully for the stones
      that night he had come in with his face and hands bloody. Why hadn't he
      kissed her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Two-Hawks&mdash;bourgeois? Utter nonsense! Of course it did not
      matter now what he was; he had dug a bridgeless chasm with that smile.
      Sometime to-morrow he and Stefani Gregor would be on their way to Montana;
      and that would be the last of them both. To-morrow would mark the fork in
      the road. But life would never again be humdrum for Kitty Conover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The taxicabs were bumping over cobbles, through empty streets. It was six
      by now; at that hour this locality, which she recognized as the warehouse
      district, was always dead. The deserted streets, how ever, set in motion a
      slight perturbation. Supposing Karlov grew suspicious and turned aside
      from his objective? Even as this disturbing thought took form Karlov's
      taxicab stopped. Kitty's stopped also, but without instructions from her.
      She had intended to drive on and from the rear window observe if Karlov
      entered that old red-brick house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; she called through the tube.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chauffeur obeyed, but he stopped again directly behind Karlov's
      taxicab. He slid off his seat and opened the door. His face was grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tumpitum-tump! Tumpitum-tump! She did not hear the tocsin this time; she
      felt it on her spine&mdash;the drums of fear. If they touched her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me, miss. If you are sensible you will not be harmed. If you
      cut up a racket I'll have to carry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; faltered Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we have finally got you, miss. You can see for yourself that there
      isn't any help in sight. Better take it sensibly. We don't intend to hurt
      you. It's somebody else we want. There's a heavy score against you, but
      we'll overlook it if you act sensibly. You were very clever last night;
      but the game depends upon the last trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go sensibly,&rdquo; Kitty agreed. They must not touch her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Karlov did not speak as he opened the door of the house for her. His
      expression was Buddha-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, miss,&rdquo; said the chauffeur, affably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an American?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever it pays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently Kitty found herself in the attic, alone. They hadn't touched
      her; so much was gained. Poor little fool that she was! It was fairly dark
      now, but overhead she could see the dim outlines of the scuttle or trap.
      The attic was empty except for a few pieces of lumber and some soap boxes.
      She determined to investigate the trap at once, before they came again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed two soap boxes on end and laid a plank across. After testing
      its stability she mounted. She could reach the trap easily, with plenty of
      leverage to spare. She was confident that she could draw herself up to the
      roof. She sought for the hooks and liberated them, then she placed her
      palms against the trap and heaved. Not even a creak answered her. She
      pressed upward again and again. The trap was immovable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Light. She turned, to behold Karlov in the doorway, a candlestick in his
      hand. &ldquo;The scuttle is covered with cement, Miss Conover. Nobody can get in
      or out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty got down, her knees uncertain. If he touched her! Oh, the fool she
      had been!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do with me?&rdquo; she asked through dry lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to me a bill of exchange, payable in something more precious to
      me than gold. I am going to keep you here until you are ransomed. The
      ransom is the man you have been shielding. If he isn't here by midnight
      you vanish. Oh, we shan't harm you. Merely you will disappear until my
      affairs in America are terminated. You are clever and resourceful for so
      young a woman. You will understand that we are not going to turn aside.
      You are not a woman to me; you are a valuable pawn. You are something to
      bargain for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Kitty, her heart trying to burst through. It seemed
      impossible that Karlov should not hear the thunder. To placate him, to
      answer his questions, to keep him from growing angry!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would.&rdquo; Karlov set the candle on Kitty's impromptu
      stepladder. &ldquo;We saw your interest in the affair, and attacked you on that
      side. You had seen me once. Being a newspaper writer&mdash;the New York
      kind&mdash;you would not rest until you learned who I was. You would not
      forget me. You were too well guarded uptown. You have been out of the city
      for a week. We could not find where. You were reported seen entering your
      office this morning; and here you are. My one fear was that you might not
      see me. Personally you will have no cause to worry. No hand shall touch
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't misunderstand. There is no sentiment behind this promise. I imagine
      your protector will sacrifice much for your sake. Simply it is unnecessary
      to offer you any violence. Do you know who the man is your protector is
      shielding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he played the fiddle for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Karlov smiled. &ldquo;Did you dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dance? I don't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter. He can play the fiddle nearly as well as his master. The two
      of them have gone across the world fiddling the souls of women out of
      their bodies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty sat down weakly on the plank. Terror from all points. Karlov's
      unexcited tones&mdash;his lack of dramatic gesture&mdash;convinced her
      that this was deadly business. Terror that for all the promise of immunity
      they might lay hands on her. Terror for Johnny Two-Hawks, for Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he injured you?&rdquo; she asked, to gain time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is an error in chronology. He represents an idea which no longer
      exists.&rdquo; He spoke English fluently, but with a rumbling accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to kill him for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill him? My dear young lady, I merely want him to fiddle for me,&rdquo; said
      Karlov with another smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tried to kill him,&rdquo; insisted Kitty, the dryness beginning to leave
      her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bungling agents. Do know what became of them&mdash;the two who invaded
      your bedroom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were taken away the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I thought. What became of the wallet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it hidden on the back of my stove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought to look there,&rdquo; said Karlov, musingly. &ldquo;Who has the
      drums?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The emeralds? You haven't them!&rdquo; cried Kitty, becoming her mother's
      daughter, though her heart never beat so thunderously as now. &ldquo;We thought
      you had them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Karlov stared at her, moodily. &ldquo;What is that button for, at the side of
      your bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty comprehended the working of the mind that formulated this question.
      If she answered truthfully he would accept her statements. &ldquo;It rings an
      alarm in the basement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Karlov nodded. &ldquo;You are truthful and sensible I haven't the emeralds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps one of your men betrayed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of that. But if he had betrayed me the drums would have
      been discovered by the police.... Damn them to hell!&rdquo; Kitty wondered
      whether he meant the police or the emeralds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Later, food and a blanket will be brought to you. If your ransom does not
      appear by midnight you will be taken away. If you struggle we may have to
      handle you roughly. That is as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Karlov went out, locking the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the blind little fool she had been! All those constant warnings, and
      she had not heeded! Cutty had warned her repeatedly, so had Bernini; and
      she had deliberately walked into this trap. As if this cold, murderous
      madman would risk showing himself without some grim and terrible purpose.
      She had written either Cutty's or Johnny Two-Hawks' death warrant. She
      covered her eyes. It was horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps not Cutty, but assuredly Two-hawks. His life for her liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he will come!&rdquo; she whispered. She knew it. How, was not to be
      analyzed. She just knew that he would come. What if he had smiled like
      that! The European point of view and her own monumental folly. He would
      come quietly, without protest, and give himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forgive me! What can I do? What can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slid to the floor and rocked her body. Her fault! He would come&mdash;even
      as Cutty would have come had he been the man demanded. And Karlov would
      kill him&mdash;because he was an error in chronology! She sensed also that
      the anarchist would not look upon his act as murder. He would be removing
      an obstacle from the path of his sick dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comparisons! She saw how much alike the two were. Cutty was only Johnny
      Two-Hawks at fifty-two&mdash;fearless and whimsical. Had Cutty gone
      through life without looking at some woman as, last night, Two-Hawks had
      looked at her? All the rest of her life she would see Two-Hawks' eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abysmal fool, to pit her wits against such men as Karlov! Because she had
      been successful to a certain extent, she had overrated her cleverness,
      with this tragic result... He had fiddled the soul out of her. But death!
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang up. It was maddening to sit still, to feel the approach of the
      tragedy without being able to prevent it. She investigated the windows. No
      hope in this direction. It was rapidly growing dark outside. What time was
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened. A man she had not seen before came in with a blanket, a
      pitcher of water, and some graham crackers. His fingers were stained a
      brilliant yellow and a peculiar odour emanated from his clothes. He did
      not speak to her, but set the articles on the floor and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty did not stir. An hour passed; she sat as one in a trance. The tallow
      dip was sinking. By and by she became conscious of a faint sound, a
      tapping. Whence it came she could not tell. She moved about cautiously,
      endeavouring to locate it. When she finally did the blood drummed in her
      ears. The trap! Someone was trying to get in through the trap!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty! Thus soon! Who else could it be? She hunted for a piece of lumber
      light enough to raise to the trap. She tapped three times, and waited.
      Silence. She repeated the signal. This time it was answered. Cutty! In a
      little while she would be free, and Two-Hawks would not have to pay for
      her folly with his life. Terror and remorse departed forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the plank to the door and pushed one end under the door knob.
      Then she piled the other planks against the butt. The moment she heard
      steps on the stairs she would stand on the planks. It would be difficult
      to open that door. She sat down on the planks to wait. From time to time
      she built up the falling tallow. Cutty must have light. The tapping on the
      trap went on. They were breaking away the cement. Perhaps an hour passed.
      At least it seemed a very long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steps on the stairs! She stood up, facing the door, the roots of her hair
      tingling. She heard the key turn in the lock; and then as in a nightmare
      she felt the planks under her feet stir slightly but with sinister
      persistence. She presently saw the toe of a boot insert, itself between
      the door and the jamb. The pressure increased; the space between the door
      and the jamb widened. Suddenly the boot vanished, the door closed, and the
      plank fell. Immediately thereafter Karlov stood inside the room, scowling
      suspiciously.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cutty arrived at the apartment in time to share dinner with Hawksley. He
      had wisely decided to say nothing about the escapade of Hawksley and Kitty
      Conover, since it had terminated fortunately. Bernini had telegraphed the
      gist of the adventure. He could readily understand Hawksley's part; but
      Kitty's wasn't reducible to ordinary terms of expression. The young chap
      had run wild because his head still wobbled on his shoulders and because
      his isolation was beginning to scratch his nerves. But for Kitty to run
      wild with him offered a blank wall to speculation. (As if he could solve
      the riddle when Kitty herself could not!) So he determined to shut himself
      up in his study and shuffle the chrysoprase. Something might come of it.
      Looking backward, he recognized the salient, at no time had he been quite
      sure of Kitty. She seemed to be a combination of shallows and unfathomable
      deeps.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Pennsylvania Station he had called up the office. Kitty had gone.
      Bernini informed him that Kitty was dining at a cafe on the way home.
      Cutty was thorough. He telephoned the restaurant and was advised that Miss
      Conover had reserved a table. He had forgotten to send down the operative
      who guarded Kitty at that end. But the distance from the office to the
      Subway was so insignificant!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are looking fit,&rdquo; he said across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought to be off your hands by Monday. But what about Stefani Gregor? I
      can't stir, leaving him hanging on a peg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going into the study shortly to decide that. Head bother you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Occasionally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ryan easy to get along with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a good sort. I say, you know, you've seen a good deal of life.
      Which do you consider the stronger, the inherited traits or environment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Environment. That is the true mould. There is good and bad in all of us.
      It is brought into prominence by the way we live. An angel cannot touch
      pitch without becoming defiled. On the other hand, the worst gutter rats
      in the world saved France. Do you suppose that thought will not always be
      tugging at and uplifting those who returned from the first Marne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is hope, then, for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You know that my father, my uncle, and my grandfather were fine
      scoundrels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under their influence you would have been one, too. But no man could live
      with Stefani Gregor and not absorb his qualities. Your environment has
      been Anglo-Saxon, where the first block in the picture is fair play. You
      have been constantly under the tutelage of a fine and lofty personality,
      Gregor's. Whatever evil traits you may have inherited, they have become
      subject to the influences that have surrounded you. Take me, for instance.
      I was born in a rather puritanical atmosphere. My environments have always
      been good. Yet there lurks in me the taint of Macaire. Given the wrong
      environment, I should now have my picture in the Rogues' Gallery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley played with his fork. &ldquo;If you had a daughter would you trust me
      with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Any man who can weep unashamed over the portrait of his mother may
      be trusted. Once you are out there in Montana you'll forget all about your
      paternal forbears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Handsome beggar, thought Cutty; but evidently born under the opal. An
      inexplicable resentment against his guest stirred his heart. He resented
      his youth, his ease of manner, his fluency in the common tongue. He was
      theoretically a Britisher; he thought British; approached subjects from a
      British point of view. A Britisher&mdash;except when he had that fiddle
      tucked under his chin. Then Cutty admitted he did not know what he was.
      Devil take him!
    </p>
    <p>
      There must have been something electrical in Cutty's resentment, for the
      object of it felt it subtly, and it fired his own. He resented the freedom
      of action that had always been denied him, resented his host's mental and
      physical superiority. Did Cutty care for the girl, or was he playing the
      game as it had been suggested to him? Money and freedom. But then, it was
      in no sense a barter; she would be giving nothing, and the old beggar
      would be asking nothing. His suggestion! He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the joke?&rdquo; asked Cutty, looking up from his coffee, which he was
      stirring with unnecessary vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't a joke. I'm bally well twisted. I laugh now when I think of
      something tragic. I am sorry about last night. I was mad, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty listened intently and smiled occasionally. Mad as hatters, both of
      them. He and Kitty couldn't have gone on a romp like this, but Kitty and
      Hawksley could. Thereupon his resentment boiled up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any idea why she took such a risk? Why she came here, knowing me
      to be absent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She spoke of a problem. I fancy it related to your approaching marriage.
      She told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty laid down his spoon. &ldquo;I'd like to dump Your Highness into the middle
      of East River for putting that idea into my head. She has consented to it;
      and now, damn it, I've got to back out of it!&rdquo; Cutty rose and flung down
      his napkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the bewildered Hawksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because there is in me the making of a first-rate scoundrel, and I never
      should have known it if you and your affairs hadn't turned up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty entered his study and slammed the door, leaving Hawksley prey to so
      many conflicting emotions that his head began to bother him. Back out of
      it! Why? Why should Kitty have a problem to solve over such a marriage of
      convenience, and why should the old thoroughbred want to back out?
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty would be free, then? A flash of fire, which subsided quickly under
      the smothering truth. What if she were free? He could not ask her to be
      his wife. Not because of last night's madness. That no longer troubled
      him. She was the sort who would understand, if he told her. She had a soul
      big with understanding. It was that he walked in the shadow of death, and
      would so long as Karlov was free; and he could not ask any woman to share
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed back his chair slowly. In the living room he took the Amati from
      its case and began improvising. What the chrysoprase did for Cutty the
      fiddle did for this derelict&mdash;solved problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reviewed all the phases as he played. That dish of bacon and eggs, the
      resolute air of her, that popping fan! [Allegretto.] She had found him
      senseless on the floor. She had had the courage to come to his assistance.
      [Andante con espressione.] What had been in her mind that night she had
      taken flight from his bedroom, after having given him the wallet?
      Something like tears. What about? An American girl, natural, humorous, and
      fanciful. Somehow he felt assured that it had not been his kisses; she had
      looked into his eyes and seen the taint. Always there, the beast that old
      Stefani had chained and subdued. He knew now that this beast would never
      again lift its head. And he had let her go without a sign.
      [Dolorosomente.] To have gone through life with a woman who would have
      understood his nature. The test of her had been last night in the streets.
      His mood had been hers. [Allegretto con amore.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love,&rdquo; he said, lowering the bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love,&rdquo; said Cutty, shifting his chrysoprase. There was no fool like an
      old fool. It did not serve to recall Molly in all her glory, to reach
      hither and yon for a handhold to pull him out of this morass. Molly had
      become an invisible ghost. He loved her daughter. Double sunset; the
      phenomenon of the Indian Ocean was now being enacted upon his own horizon.
      Double sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why should Kitty have any problem to solve? Why should she dodder over
      such a trifle as this prospective official marriage? It was only a joke
      which would legalize his generosity. She had sent that telegram after
      leaving this apartment. What had happened here to decide her? Had Hawksley
      fiddled? There was something the matter with the green stones to-night;
      they evoked nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back in his chair, listening, the bowl of his pipe touching the
      lapel of his coat. Music. Queer, what you could do with a fiddle if you
      knew how.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all there was no sense in venting his anger on Hawksley. He was
      hoist by his own petard. Why not admit the truth? He had had a crack on
      the head the same night as Hawksley; only, he had been struck by an idea,
      often more deadly than the butt of a pistol. He would apologize for that
      roaring exit from the dining room. The poor friendless devil! He bent
      toward the green stones again. In the living room Hawksley sat in a chair,
      the fiddle across his knees. He understood now. The old chap was in love
      with the girl, and was afraid of himself; couldn't risk having her and
      letting her go.... A curse on the drums of jeopardy! Misfortune followed
      their wake always. The world would have been different this hour if he&mdash;The
      break in the trend of thought was caused by the entrance of Kuroki, who
      was followed by a man. This man dropped into a chair without apparently
      noticing that the room was already tenanted, for he never glanced toward
      Hawksley. A haggard face, dull of eye. Kuroki bobbed and vanished, but
      returned shortly, beckoning the stranger to follow him into the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coles?&rdquo; cried Cutty delightedly. Here was the man he had sent to
      negotiate for the emeralds, free. &ldquo;How did you escape? We've combed the
      town for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had me in a room on Fifteenth Street. Once in a while I got
      something to eat. But I haven't escaped. I'm still a prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here as an emissary. There was nothing for me to do but accept the
      job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he have the stones?&rdquo; asked Cutty, without the least suspicion of what
      was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I don't know. He pretended to have them in order to get me where he
      wanted me. I've been hungry a good deal because I wouldn't talk. I'm here
      as a negotiator. A rotten business. I agreed because I've hopes you'll be
      able to put one over on Karlov. It's the girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Karlov has her. The girl wasn't to blame. Any one in the game would have
      done as she did. Karlov is bugs on politics; but he's shrewd enough at
      this sort of game. He trapped the girl because he'd studied her enough to
      learn what she would or would not do. Now they are not going to hurt her.
      They merely propose exchanging her for the man you've been hiding up here.
      There's a taxi downstairs. It will carry me back to Fifteenth; then it
      will return and wait. If the man is not at the appointed place by midnight&mdash;he
      must go in this taxi&mdash;the girl will be carried off elsewhere, and
      you'll never lay eyes on her again. Karlov and his gang are potential
      assassins; all they want is excuse. Until midnight they will not touch the
      girl; but after midnight, God knows! What message am I to take back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where she is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty spoke without much outward emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least idea. Whenever Karlov wanted to quiz me, he appeared late
      at night from some other part of the town. But he never got much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw him this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It probably struck him as a fine joke to send me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you don't go back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl will be taken away. I'm honestly afraid of the man. He's too
      quiet spoken. That kind of a man always goes the limit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Wait here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Cutty's approach Hawksley looked up apathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are pale. Anything serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Karlov has got Kitty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a minute Hawksley did not stir. Then he got up, put away the Amati,
      and came back. He was pale, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They will exchange her for me. Am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But you are not obliged to do anything like that, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You give yourself up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a man!&rdquo; Cutty burst out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was brought up by one. Honestly, now, could I ever look a white man in
      the face again if I didn't give myself up? I did begin to believe that I
      might get through. But Fate was only playing with me. May I use your desk
      to write a line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said Cutty, unsteadily. This was not the result of
      environment. Quiet courage of this order was race. No questions demanding
      if there wasn't some way round the inevitable. Cutty's heart glowed; the
      boy had walked into it, never to leave it. &ldquo;I'm ready.&rdquo; It took a man to
      say that when the sequence was death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coles,&rdquo; said Cutty upon reentering the study, &ldquo;tell Karlov that His
      Highness will give himself up. He will be there before midnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's enough for me. But if there's the least sign that you're not
      playing straight it will be all off. Two men will be watching the taxi and
      the entrance. If you appear, it's good-night. They told me to warn you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise not to appear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coles smiled enigmatically and reached for his hat. He held his hand out
      to Hawksley. &ldquo;You're a white man, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Hawksley, absently. To have it all over with!
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the captive Federal agent withdrew Hawksley sat down at the
      desk and wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will this hold legally?&rdquo; he asked, extending the written sheet to Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty saw that it was a simple will. In it Hawksley gave half of his
      possessions to Kitty and half to Stefani Gregor. In case the latter was
      dead the sum total was to go to Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got you into a muddle; this will take you out of it. Karlov will kill
      me. I don't know how. I am his obsession. He will sleep better with me off
      his mind. Will this hold legally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But why Kitty Conover, a stranger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is a woman who saves your life a stranger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not exactly. This is what we might call zero hour. I gave you a
      haven here not particularly because I was sorry for you, but because I
      wanted those emeralds. Once upon a time Gregor showed them to me. Until I
      examined your wallet I supposed you had smuggled in the stones; and that
      would have been fair game. But you had paid your way in honestly. Now,
      what did you do to Kitty Conover last night that decided her to accept
      that fool proposition? She sent her acceptance after she left you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know that. I played for her. She became music-struck, and I
      took advantage of it&mdash;kissed her. Then she told me she was going to
      marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is why you asked me if I would trust you with a daughter of
      mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conscience. That explains this will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Why did you accept my suggestion to marry her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make her comfortable without sidestepping the rules of convention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Because you love her&mdash;the way I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty's pipe slipped from his teeth. It did not often do that. He stamped
      out the embers and laid the pipe on the tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think I love her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes me tell you that I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, death may be at the end of to-night's work; so I'll admit that I
      love her. She is like a forest stream, wild at certain turns, but always
      sweet and clear. I'm an old fool, old enough to be her father. I loved her
      mother. Can a man love two women with all his heart, one years after the
      other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the avatar; she is the reincarnation of the mother. I understand
      now. What was a beautiful memory takes living form again. You still love
      the mother; the daughter has revived that love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Lord Harry, I believe you've struck it! Walked into the fog and
      couldn't find the way out. Of course. What an old ass I've been! Simple as
      daylight. I've simply fallen in love with Molly all over again, thinking
      it was Kitty. Plain as the nose on my face. And I might have made a fine
      mess of it if you hadn't waked me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this gentle irony went over Hawksley's head. &ldquo;When do you wish me to
      go down to the taxi?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Son, I'm beginning to like you. You shall have your chance. In fact,
      we'll take it together. There'll be a taxi but I'll hire it. I'm quite
      positive I know where Kitty is. If I'm correct you'll have your chance. If
      I'm wrong you'll have to pay the score. We'll get her out or we'll stay
      where she is. In any event, Karlov will pay the price. Wouldn't you prefer
      to go out&mdash;if you must&mdash;in a glorious scrap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fighting?&rdquo; Hawksley was on his feet instantly. &ldquo;Do you mean that? I can
      die with free hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a chance of coming out top-hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, what a ripping thing hope is&mdash;always springing back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty nodded. But he knew there was one hope that would never warm his
      heart again. Molly!... Well, he'd let the young chap believe that. Kitty
      must never know. Poor little chick, fighting with her soul in the dark and
      not knowing what the matter was! Such things happened. He had loved Molly
      on sight. He had loved Kitty on sight. In neither case had he known it
      until too late to turn about. Mother and daughter; a kind of sacrilege, as
      if he had betrayed Molly! But what a clear vision acknowledged love lent
      to the mind! He understood Kitty, who did not understand herself. Well,
      this night's adventure would decide things.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. Neither Kitty nor the drums of jeopardy; nothing. The gates of
      paradise again&mdash;for somebody else! Whoever heard of a prompter
      receiving press notices?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's look alive! We haven't any time to waste. We'll have to change to
      dungarees&mdash;engineer togs. There'll be some tools to carry. We go
      straight down to the boiler room. We come up the ash exit on the street
      side. Remember, no suspicious haste. Two engineers off for their evening
      swig of beer at the corner groggery. Through the side door there, and into
      my taxi. Obey every order I give. Now run along to Kuroki and say night
      work for both of us. He'll understand what's wanted. I'll set the
      machinery in motion for a raid. How do you feel? I want the truth. I don't
      want to turn to you for help and not get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley laughed. &ldquo;Don't worry about me. I'll carry on. Don't you
      understand? To have an end of it, one way or the other! To come free or to
      die there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if Kitty is not where I believe her to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll return to the taxi outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To be young like that! thought Cutty, feeling strangely sad and old. &ldquo;To
      come free or to die there!&rdquo; That was good Anglo-Saxon. He would make a
      good American citizen&mdash;if he were in luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half after nine the two of them knelt on the roof before the cemented
      trap. Nothing but raging heat disintegrates cement. So the liberation of
      this trap, considering the time, was a Herculean task, because it had to
      be accomplished with little or no noise. Cold chisels, fulcrums, prying,
      heaving, boring. To free the under edge; the top did not matter. Not
      knowing if Kitty were below&mdash;that was the worst part of the job.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweat of agony ran down Hawksley's face; but he never faltered. He was
      going to die to-night, somehow, somewhere, but with free hands, the way
      Stefani would have him die, the way the girl would have him die. All these
      thousands of miles&mdash;to die in a house he had never seen before, just
      when life was really worth something!
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour went by. Then they heard Kitty's signal. Instinctively the two of
      them knew that the taps came from her. They were absolutely certain when
      her signal was repeated. She was below, alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faster!&rdquo; whispered Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley smiled. To say that to a chap when he was digging into his tomb!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sides of the trap were free Cutty tapped to Kitty again. There
      was a long, agonizing wait. Then three taps came from below. Cutty flashed
      a signal to the warehouse windows. In five minutes the raid would be in
      full swing&mdash;from the roof, from the street, from the cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      With their short crowbars braced by stout fulcrums the two men heaved.
      Noise did not matter now. Presently the trap went over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out for your hands; there's lots of loose glass. And together when
      we drop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right-o!&rdquo; whispered Hawksley, assured that when he dropped through the
      trap the result would be oblivion. Done in.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Karlov, upon forcing his way past Kitty's barricade, stared at her
      doubtfully. This was a clever girl; she had proved her cleverness
      frequently. She might have some reason other than fear in keeping him out.
      So he put a fresh candle in the sconce and began to prowl. He pierced the
      attic windows with a ranging glance; no one was in the yard or on the
      Street. The dust on the windows had not been disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Kitty the suspense was intolerable. At any moment Cutty might tap a
      query to her. How to warn him that all was not well? A scream would do it;
      but in that event when Cutty arrived there would be no Kitty Conover.
      Something that would sound unusual to Cutty and accidental to Karlov. She
      hit upon it. She seized a plank from her barricade, raised it to a
      perpendicular position, then flung it down violently. Would Cutty hear and
      comprehend that she was warning him? As a matter of fact, Cutty never
      heard the crash, for at that particular minute he was standing up to get
      the kinks out of his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karlov whirled on his heels, ran to Kitty, and snatched her wrist. &ldquo;Why
      did you do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty remained mute. &ldquo;Answer!&rdquo;&mdash;with a cruel twist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hurt!&rdquo; she gasped. Anything to gain time. She tried to break away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to thrust it through a window to attract attention. It was
      too heavy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This explanation was within bounds of reason. It is possible that Karlov&mdash;who
      had merely come up with a fresh candle&mdash;would have departed but for a
      peculiarly grim burst of humour on the part of Fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tap&mdash;tap&mdash;tap? inquired the unsuspecting man on the roof&mdash;exactly
      to Kitty like some innocent, inquisitive child embarrassing the family
      before company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karlov flung her aside roughly, stepped under the trap, and cupped an ear.
      He required no explanations from Kitty, who shrank to the wall and
      remained pinned there by terror. Karlov's intuition was keen. Men on the
      roof held but one significance. The house was surrounded by Federal
      agents. For a space he wavered between two desires, the political and the
      private vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A call down the stairs, and five minutes afterward there would be nothing
      on the spot but a jumble of smoking wood and brick. But not to see them
      die!
    </p>
    <p>
      His subsequent acts, cold and methodical, fascinated Kitty. He took a step
      toward her. The scream died in her throat. But he did not go beyond that
      step. The picture of her terror decided his future actions. He would see
      them die, here, with the girl looking on. A full measure. Well enough he
      knew who were digging away the cement of the trap. What gave lodgment to
      this conviction he did not bother to analyze. The man he had not yet seen,
      who had balked him, now here, now there, from that first night; and who
      but the last of that branch of the hated house should be with him? To
      rend, batter, crush, kill! If he were bound for hell, to go there with the
      satisfaction of knowing that his private vengeance had been cancelled. The
      full reckoning for Anna's degradation: Stefani Gregor, broken and dying,
      and all the others dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      He would shoot them as they dropped through the trap. Not to kill, but to
      maim, render helpless; then he would taunt them and grind his heels in
      their faces. Up there, the two he most hated of all living men!
    </p>
    <p>
      First he restored Kitty's barricade&mdash;to keep assistance from entering
      before his work was completed. The butt of the first plank he pushed under
      the door knob. The other planks he laid flat, end to end, with the butt of
      the last snug against the brick chimney. The door would never give as a
      whole; it would have to be smashed in by axes. He then set the candle on
      the floor, backed by an up-ended soapbox. His enemies would drop into a
      pool of light, while they would not be able to see him at once. The girl
      would not matter. Her terror would hold her for some time. These
      manoeuvres completed, he answered the signal, sat down on another box and
      waited, reminding Kitty of some grotesque Mongolian idol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty saw the inevitable. Thereupon her terror ceased to bind her. As
      Cutty flung back the trap she would cry out a warning. Karlov might&mdash;and
      probably would&mdash;kill her. Her share in this night's work&mdash;her
      incredible folly&mdash;required full payment. Having decided to die with
      Cutty, all her courage returned. This is the normal result of any sublime
      resolve. But with the return of her courage she evolved another plan. She
      measured the distance between herself and Karlov, calculating there would
      be three strides. As Cutty dropped she would fling herself upon the
      madman. The act would at least give Cutty something like equal terms. What
      became of Kitty Conover thereafter was of no importance to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sounds. She became conscious of noises elsewhere in the house. The floor
      trembled. There came a creaking and snapping of wood, and she heard the
      trap fall. Karlov stood up, menacing, terrible. She saw where Cutty would
      drop, and now understood the cunning of the manoeuvre of placing the
      candle in front of the soapbox. Cutty would be an absolute mark for
      Karlov, protected by the shadow. She set herself, as a runner at the tape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karlov was not the type criminal, which when cornered, thinks only of
      personal safety. He was a political fanatic. All who opposed his beliefs
      must not be permitted to survive. There was a touch of Torquemada of the
      Inquisition in his cosmos. He could not kill directly; he had to torture
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew by the ascending sounds that there would be no way out of this for
      him. To the American, Russia was an outlaw. He would be treated as a
      dangerous alien enemy and locked up. Boris Karlov should never live to eat
      his heart out behind bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unique angle of thought, he mused. He wanted mud to trample them in,
      Russian mud. The same mud that had filled the mouth of Anna's destroyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, then, a formidable antagonist for any two strong men; let alone
      two one of whom was rather spent, the other dizzy with pain, holding
      himself together by the last shreds of his will. They dropped through the
      trap, Cutty in front of the candle, Hawksley a little to one side. The
      elder man landed squarely, but Hawksley fell backward. He crawled to his
      feet, swaying drunkenly. For a space he was not sure of the reality of the
      scene.... Torches and hobnailed boots!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; said Karlov.
    </p>
    <p>
      The torturer must talk; he must explain the immediate future to double the
      agony. He could have maimed them both, then trampled them to death, but he
      had to inform them of the fact. He pointed the automatic at Cutty because
      he considered this man the more dangerous of the two. He at once saw that
      the other was a negligible factor. He spoke slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the girl shall witness your agonies,&rdquo; he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty, bereft of invention, could only stare. Death! He had faced it many
      times, but always with a chance. There was none here, and the absolute
      knowledge paralyzed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Cutty been alone Kitty would have rushed at the madman; but the sight
      of Hawksley robbed her of all mobility. His unexpected appearance was to
      her the Book of Revelation. The blind alley she had entered and reentered
      so many times and so futilely crumbled.... Johnny Two-Hawks!
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Hawksley, he knew he had but little time. The floor was billowing;
      he saw many candles where he knew there was only one. He was losing his
      senses. There remained but a single idea&mdash;to do the old thoroughbred
      one favour for the many. Scorning death&mdash;perhaps inviting it&mdash;he
      lunged headlong at Karlov's knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reckless challenge to death was so unexpected that Karlov had no time
      to aim. He fired at chance. The bullet nipped the left shoulder of
      Hawksley's coat and shattered the laths of the partition between the attic
      and the servant's quarters. Under the impact of the human catapult Karlov
      staggered back, desperately striving to maintain his balance. He succeeded
      because Hawksley's senses left him in the instant he struck Karlov's
      knees. Still, the episode was a respite for Cutty, who dashed at Karlov
      before the latter could set himself or raise the smoking automatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty then witnessed&mdash;dimly&mdash;a primordial, titanic conflict
      which haunted her dreams for many nights to come. They were no longer men,
      but animals; the tiger giving combat to the gorilla, one striking the
      quick, terrible blows of the tiger, the other seeking always to come to
      grips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The floor answered under the step and rush. Rare athletes, these two; big
      men who were light on their feet. Kitty could see their faces occasionally
      and the flash of their bare hands, but of their bodies little or nothing.
      Nor could she tell how the struggle was going. Indeed until the idea came
      that they might be trampling Johnny Two-Hawks there was no coherent
      thought in her head, only broken things.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran to the soapbox and kicked it aside. She saw Hawksley on his face,
      motionless. At least they should not trample his dead body. She caught
      hold of his arms and dragged him to the wall&mdash;to discover that she
      was sobbing, sobs of rage and despair that tore at her breast horribly and
      clogged her throat. She was a woman and could not help; she could not help
      Cutty! She was a woman, and all she could do was to drag aside the
      lifeless body of the man who had given Cutty his chance!
    </p>
    <p>
      She knelt, turning Hawksley over on his back. There was a slight gash on
      one grimy cheek, possibly caused by contact with the latchets of Karlov's
      boots. She raised the handsome head, pressed it to her bosom, and began to
      sway her body from side to side. Tumult. The Federal agents were throwing
      their bodies against the door repeatedly. In the semi-darkness Cutty
      fought for his life. But Kitty neither heard nor saw. The world had
      suddenly contracted; there was only this beautiful head in her arms;
      beyond and about, nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty felt his strength ebbing; soon he would not be able to wrench
      himself loose from those terrible arms. He knew all the phases of the
      fighting game. Chivalry and fair play had no part in this contest. Clear
      light, to observe what his blows were accomplishing; a minute or two of
      clear light! Half the time his blows glanced. The next time those arms
      wound about him, that would be the end. He was growing tired, winded; he
      had not gone into battle fresh. He knew that many of his blows had gone
      home. Any ordinary man would have dropped; but Karlov came on again and
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the while Karlov was not fighting Cutty; he was endeavouring to
      remove him. He was an obstacle. What Karlov wanted was that head the girl
      was holding in her arms; to grind his heel into it. Had Cutty stepped
      aside Karlov would have rushed for the other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, the door, the door!&rdquo; Cutty shouted in despair, taking a terrible
      kick on the thigh. &ldquo;The door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty did not stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      A panel in the door crushed in. The sole of a boot appeared and vanished.
      Then an arm reached in, groping, touched the plank propped under the door
      knob, wrenched and tugged until it fell. Immediately the attic became
      filled with men. It was time. Karlov had Cutty in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      This turn in the affair roused Kitty. Presently she saw men in a snarl,
      heaving and billowing, with a sudden subsidence. The snarl untangled
      itself; men began to step back and produce pocketlamps. Kitty saw Cutty's
      face, battered and bloody, appear and disappear in a flash. She saw
      Karlov's, too, as he was pulled to his feet, his hands manacled. Again she
      saw Cutty. With shaking hand he was trying to attach the loose end of his
      collar to the button. The absurdity of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him away. But don't be rough with him. He's only a poor devil of a
      madman,&rdquo; said Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karlov turned and calmly spat into Cutty's face. A dozen fists were
      raised, but Cutty intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Let him be. Just take him away and lock him up. He's a rough road to
      travel. And hustle a comfortable car for me to go home in. Not a word to
      the newspapers. This isn't a popular raid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the attic was cleared Cutty limped over to Molly Conover's
      daughter. The poor innocent! The way she was holding that head was an
      illumination. With a reassuring smile&mdash;an effort, for his lips were
      puffed and burning&mdash;he knelt and put his hand on Hawksley's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done in, Kitty; that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn't dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, no! He had nine lives, this chap, and only one of 'em missing to
      date. But I had no right to let him come. I thought he was fairly fit, but
      he wasn't. Saved my life, though. Kitty, your Johnny Two-Hawks is a real
      man; how real I did not know until to-night. He has earned his American
      citizenship. Fights like he fiddles&mdash;on all four strings. All our
      troubles are at an end; so buck up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alive? He is alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wild joy in her voice! &ldquo;Yes, ma'am; and we two can regularly thank him
      for being alive also. That lunge gave me my chance. He's only stunned.
      Perhaps he'll need a nurse again. Anyhow, he'll be coming round in a
      minute or two. I'll wager the first thing he does is to smile. I should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Kitty grew strangely shy. She became conscious of her anomalous
      position. She had promised to marry Cutty, promised herself that she would
      be his true wife&mdash;and here she was, holding another man's head to her
      heart as if it were the most precious head in all the world. She could not
      put that head upon the floor at once; that would be a confession of her
      embarrassment; and yet she could not continue to hold Hawksley while Cutty
      eyed her with semi-humorous concern. Cutty was merciful, however. &ldquo;Let me
      hold him while you make a pillow out of your coat.&rdquo; After he had laid
      Hawksley's head on the coat he said: &ldquo;He'll come about quicker this way.
      We've had some excitement, haven't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want any more, Cutty; never any more. I've been a silly, romantic
      fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not silly, only glorious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your poor face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Banged up? Well, honestly, it feels as it looks, Kitty, this chap was
      going to give himself up in exchange for you. Not a word of protest, not a
      question. All he said was: 'I am ready.' That's why I'm always going to be
      on his side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did that&mdash;for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you. Did it never occur to you that you're the sort folks always want
      to do things for if you'll let them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, Cutty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's always blessing me, Kitty. He blessed me with your mother's
      friendship, now yours. Kitty, I'm going to jilt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jilt me?&rdquo;&mdash;her heart leaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am. We can't go through with that mummery. We aren't built that
      way. I'll figure it out in some other fashion. But marriage is a sacred
      contract; and this farce would have left a scar on your honest mind. You'd
      have to tell some man. Your kind can't go through life without being
      loved. Would he understand? I wonder. He'll be human or you wouldn't fall
      in love with him; and always he'll be pondering and bedevilling himself
      with queer ideas&mdash;because he'll be human. Of course there's a
      loophole&mdash;you can sue me for breach of promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Cutty; don't laugh! You're one of those men they call
      Greathearts. And now I'm going to tell you something. It wasn't going to
      be a farce. I intended to become your true wife, Cutty, make you as happy
      as I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty patted her hand and got up. Lord, how bruised and sore his old body
      was!... His true wife! She might have been his if he had not missed that
      train. But for this hour, hot with life, she might never have discovered
      that she loved Hawksley. His true wife! Ah, she would have been all of
      that&mdash;Molly's girl!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you mind waiting here until I see where old Stefani Gregor is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Kitty, dreamily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty limped to the door. Outside he leaned against the partition. Done
      in, body and soul. Always opening the gates of paradise for somebody
      else... His true wife! Slowly he descended the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone, Kitty smoothed back the dank hair from Hawksley's brow, which she
      kissed. Benediction and good-bye.

      CHAPTER XXXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Because it was assumed that some of Karlov's pack might be at large and
      unsuspectingly return to the trap, Federal agents would remain on guard
      all night. They explored the house, hunting for chemicals, documents,
      letters, and addresses. They found enough high explosive to blow up the
      district. And they found Stefani Gregor. They were standing by the cot as
      Cutty came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Just this minute went out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman's name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Looks to me as if he had been starved to death. Know who he
      was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Tell the coroner to be gentle. Once upon a time Stefani Gregor spoke
      to kings by right of genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thought that he himself might have been the indirect cause of Gregor's
      death shocked Cutty, who was above all things tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had held back the raid for several days, to serve his own ends. He
      could have ordered the raid from Washington, and it would have gone
      through as smoothly as to-night. The drums of jeopardy. Well, that phase
      of the game was done with. He had held up this raid so that he might be on
      hand to search Karlov; and until now he had forgotten the drums. Accurst!
      They were accurst. The death of Stefani Gregor would always be on his
      conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty stared&mdash;not very clearly&mdash;at the cameo-like face so
      beautifully calm. As in life, so it was in death; the calm that had
      brooked and beaten down the turbulent instincts of the boy, the
      imperturbable calm of a great soul. Rosa. The sublime unselfishness of the
      man! He had sacrificed wealth and fame for the love of the boy's mother&mdash;unspoken,
      unrequited love, the quality that passes understanding. And his reward: to
      die on this cot, in horrid loneliness. Rosa.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once Cutty felt himself little, trivial, beside this forlorn bier.
      What did he know about love? He had never made any sacrifices; he had
      simply carried in his heart a bittersweet recollection. But here!
      Twenty-odd years of unremitting devotion to the son of the woman he had
      loved&mdash;Stefani Gregor. Creating environments that would develop the
      noble qualities in the boy, interposing himself between the boy and the
      evil pleasures of the uncle, teaching him the beautiful, cleansing his
      soul of the inherited mud. Reverently Cutty drew the coverlet over the
      fine old head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this?&rdquo; asked one of the operatives. &ldquo;Looks like the pieces of a
      broken fiddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out of those dark red bits of wood&mdash;some of them bearing the imprints
      of hobnails&mdash;Cutty constructed the scene. A wave of bitter rage
      rolled over him. The beast! Karlov had done this thing, with poor old
      Gregor looking on, too weak to intervene. Not so many years ago these bits
      of wood, under the master's touch, had entranced the souls of thousands.
      Cutty recalled a fairy tale he had read when a boy about a prince whose
      soul had been transformed into a flower which, if plucked or broken, died.
      Karlov had murdered Stefani Gregor, perhaps not legally but actually
      nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rehabilitated in soul, Cutty left the room. He had read a compelling
      lesson in self-sacrifice. He was going to pick up his cross and go on with
      it, smiling. After all, Kitty was only an interlude; the big thing was the
      game; and shortly he would be in the thick of great events again. But
      Kitty should be happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His old analytical philosophy resumed its functions. The contempt and
      jealousy of one race for another; what was God's idea in implanting that
      in souls? Hawksley was at base Russian. The boy's English education, his
      adopted outlook upon life, made it possible for Cutty to ignore the racial
      antagonism of the Anglo-Saxon for all other races. Stefani Gregor at one
      end of the world and he at the other, blindly working out the destinies of
      Kitty Conover and Ivan Mikhail Feodorovich and so forth and so on, with
      the blood of Catharine in his veins! Made a chap dizzy to think of it.
      Traditions were piling up along with crowns and sceptres in the abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to the attic he felt himself fortified against any
      inevitability. Hawksley was sitting up, his back to the wall, staring
      groggily but with reckless adoration into Kitty's lovely face. Youth will
      be served. As if, watching these two, there could be any doubt of it! And
      he had bent part of his energies toward keeping them separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he cried, cheerfully. &ldquo;Back on top again, I see. How's the head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't any; no legs; I'm nothing at all but a bit of my own imagination.
      How do you feel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the aftermath of an Irish wake.&rdquo; Then Cutty's battered face assumed
      an expression that was meant to typify gravity. &ldquo;John,&rdquo; he aid, &ldquo;I've bad
      news for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John. A glow went over the young man's aching body. John. What could that
      signify except that he had passed into the eternal friendship of this old
      thoroughbred? John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Stefani?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stefani is dead. He died speaking your mother's name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley's head sank; his chin touched his chest. He spoke without looking
      up. &ldquo;Something told me I would never see him alive again. Old Stefani! If
      there is any good in me it will be his handiwork. I say,&rdquo; he added, his
      eyes now seeking Cutty's, &ldquo;you called me John. Will you carry on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep an eye on you? So long as you may need me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come from a lawless race. Stefani had to fight. Even now I'm afraid
      sometimes. God knows I want to be all he tried to make me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're all right, John. You've reached haven; the storms hereafter will
      be outside. Besides, Stefani will always be with you. You'll never pick up
      that old Amati without feeling Stefani near. Can you stand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between the two of you, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With Kitty on one side and Cutty on the other Hawksley managed the descent
      tolerably well. Often a foot dragged. How strong she was, this girl! No
      hysterics, no confusion, after all that racket, with death&mdash;or
      something worse&mdash;reaching out toward her; calmly telling him that
      there was another step, warning him not to bear too heavily on Cutty!
      Holding him up physically and morally, these two, now all he had in life
      to care for. Yesterday, unknown to him; this night, bound by hoops of
      steel. The girl had forgiven him; he knew it by the touch of her arm....
      Old Stefani! A sob escaped him. Their arms tightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I was thinking of Stefani. Rather hard&mdash;to die all alone&mdash;because
      he loved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty longed to be alone. There were still many unshed tears&mdash;some
      for Cutty, some for Stefani Gregor, some for Johnny Two-Hawks, and some
      for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the limousine Cutty sat in the middle, Kitty on his left and Hawksley
      on his right, his arms round them both. Presently Hawksley's head touched
      his shoulder and rested there; a little later Kitty did likewise. His
      children! Lord, he was going to have a tremendous interest in life, after
      all! He smiled with kindly irony at the back of the chauffeur. His
      children, these two; and he knew as he planned their future that they were
      thinking over and round but not of him, which is the way of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the apartment Cutty decided to let Hawksley sit in an easy chair in the
      living room until Captain Harrison arrived. Kuroki was ordered to prepare
      a supper, which would be served on the tea cart, set at Hawksley's knees.
      Kitty&mdash;because it was impossible for her to remain inactive&mdash;set
      the linen and silver. She was in and out of the room, ill at ease, angry,
      frightened, bitter, avoiding Hawksley's imploring eyes because she was not
      sure of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sure of one thing, however. All the nonsense was out of her head.
      To-morrow she would be returning to the regular job. She would have a page
      from the Arabian Nights to look upon in the days to come. She understood,
      though it twisted her heart dreadfully: she was in the eyes of this man a
      plaything, a pretty woman he had met in passing. If she had saved his life
      he had in turn saved hers; they were quits. She did not blame him for his
      point of view. He had come from the top of the world, where women were
      either ornaments or playthings, while she and hers had always struggled to
      maintain equilibrium in the middle stratum. Cutty could give him
      friendship; but she could not because she was a woman, young and pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love him? Well, she would get over it. It might be only the glamour of the
      adventure they had shared. Anyhow, she wouldn't die of it. Cutty hadn't.
      Of course it hurt; she was a silly little fool, and all that. Once he was
      in Montana he would be sending for his Olga. There wasn't the least doubt
      in her mind that if ever autocracy returned to power, he'd be casting
      aside his American citizenship, his chaps and sombrero, for the old
      regalia. Well&mdash;truculently to the world at large&mdash;why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      So she avoided Hawksley's gaze, sensing the sustained persistence of it.
      But, oh, to be alone, alone, alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty washed the patient's hands and face and patched up the cut on the
      cheek, interlarding his chatter with trench idioms, banter, jokes.
      Underneath, though, he was chuckling. He was the hero of this tale; he had
      done all the thrilling stunts, carried limp bodies across fire escapes in
      the rain, climbed roofs, eluded newspaper reporters, fought with his bare
      fists, rescued the girl.... All with one foot in the grave! Fifty-two,
      gray haired&mdash;with a prospect of rheumatism on the morrow&mdash;and
      putting it over like a debonair movie idol!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley met these pleasantries halfway by grousing about being babied
      when there was nothing the matter with him but his head, his body, and his
      legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why didn't she look at him? What was the meaning of this persistent
      avoidance? She must have forgiven last night. She was too much of a
      thoroughbred to harbour ill feeling over that. Why didn't she look at him?
    </p>
    <p>
      The telephone called Cutty from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty went into the dining room for an extra pair of salt cellars and
      delayed her return until she heard Cutty coming back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Karlov is dead,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Started a fight in the taxi, got out, and
      was making for safety when one of the boys shot him. He hadn't the jewels
      on him, John. I'm afraid they are gone, unless he hid them somewhere in
      that&mdash;What's the matter, Kitty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Kitty had dropped the salt cellars and pressed her hands against her
      bosom, her face colourless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley, terrified, tried to get up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! Nothing is the matter with me but my head.... To think I could
      forget! Good&mdash;heavens!&rdquo; She prolonged the words drolly. &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her back to them. When she faced them again she extended a palm
      upon which lay a leather tobacco pouch, cracked and parched and blistered
      by the reactions of rain and sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of my forgetting them! I found them this morning. Where do you
      suppose? On a step of the fire-escape ladder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be tinker-dammed!&rdquo; said Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've reasoned it out,&rdquo; went on Kitty, breathlessly, looking at Cutty,
      &ldquo;When the anarchist tore them from Mr. Hawksley's neck, he threw them out
      of the window. The room was dark; his companion could not see. Later he
      intended, no doubt, to go into the court and recover them and cheat his
      master. I was looking out of the window, when I noticed a brilliant flash
      of purple, then another of green. The pouch was open, the stones about to
      trickle out. I dared not leave them in the apartment or tell anybody until
      you came home. So I carried them with me to the office. The drums, Cutty!
      The drums! Tumpitum-tump! Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She poured the stones upon the white linen tablecloth. A thousand fires!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wonderful things!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Oh, the wonderful things! I don't
      blame you, Cutty. They would tempt an angel. The drums of jeopardy; and
      that I should find them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; said Cutty, in an awed whisper. Green stones! The magnificent
      rubies and sapphires and diamonds vanished; he could see nothing but the
      exquisite emeralds. He picked up one&mdash;still warm with Kitty's pulsing
      life&mdash;and toyed with it. Actually, the drums! And all this time they
      had been inviting the first comer to appropriate them. Money, love,
      tragedy, death; history, pageants, lovely women; murder and loot! All
      these days on the step of the fire-escape ladder! He must have one of
      them; positively he must. Could he prevail upon Hawksley to sell one? Had
      he carried them through sentiment?
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to broach the suggestion of purchase, but remained mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley's head was sunk upon his chest; his arms hung limply at the sides
      of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is fainting!&rdquo; cried Kitty, her love outweighing her resolves. &ldquo;Cutty!&rdquo;&mdash;desperately,
      fearing to touch Hawksley herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! The stones, the stones! Take them away&mdash;out of sight! I'm too
      done in! I can't stand it! I can't&mdash;The Red Night! Torches and
      hobnailed boots!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Her fingers seemingly all thumbs, her heart swelling with misery and
      loneliness, wanting to go to him but fearing she would be misunderstood,
      Kitty scooped up the dazzling stones and poured them hastily into the
      tobacco pouch, which she thrust into Cutty's hands. What she had heard was
      not the cry of a disordered brain. There was some clear reason for the
      horror in Hawksley's tones. What tragedy lay behind these wonderful prisms
      of colour that the legitimate owner could not look upon them without being
      stirred in this manner?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take them into the study,&rdquo; urged Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; interposed Hawksley. &ldquo;I give one of the emeralds to you, Cutty.
      They came out of hell&mdash;if you want to risk it! The other is for Miss
      Conover, with Mister Hawksley's compliments.&rdquo; He was looking at Kitty now,
      his face drawn, his eyes bloodshot. &ldquo;Don't be apprehensive. They bring
      evil only to men. With one in your possession you will be happy ever
      after, as the saying goes. Oh, they are mine to give; mine by right of
      inheritance. God knows I paid for them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I said Mister&mdash;&rdquo; began Kitty, her brain confused, her tongue
      clumsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't forgiven!&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;A thoroughbred like you, to hold
      last night against me! Mister&mdash;after what we two have shared
      together! Why didn't you leave me there to die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty observed that the drama had resolved itself into two characters; he
      had been relegated to the scenes. He tiptoed toward his study door, and as
      he slipped inside he knew that Gethsemane was not an orchard but a
      condition of the mind. He tossed the pouch on his desk, eyed it
      ironically, and sat down. His, one of them&mdash;one of those marvellous
      emeralds was his! He interlaced his fingers and rested his brow upon them.
      He was very tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty missed him only when she heard the latch snap.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was alone with Hawksley; and all her terror returned. Not to touch
      him, not to console him; to stand staring at him like a dumb thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do forgive&mdash;Johnny! But your world and my world&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those stains! The wretches hurt you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Where?&rdquo;&mdash;bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blood on your waist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kitty looked down. &ldquo;That is not my blood, Johnny. It is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine?&rdquo; Johnny. Something in the way she said it. &ldquo;Mine?&rdquo;&mdash;trying to
      solve the riddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It is where your cheek rested when&mdash;I thought you were dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sense of misery, of oppression, of terror, all fell away miraculously,
      leaving only the flower of glory. She would be his plaything if he wanted
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty, I came out of a dark world&mdash;to find you. I loved you the
      moment I entered your kitchen that night. But I did not know it. I loved
      you the night you brought the wallet. Still I did not understand. It was
      when I heard the lift door and knew you had gone forever that I
      understood. Loved you with all my heart, with all that poor old Stefani
      had fashioned out of muck and clay. If you held my head to your heart, if
      that is my blood there&mdash;Do you, can you care a little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can and do care very much, Johnny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice to his ears was like the G string of the Amati. &ldquo;Will you go
      with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere. But you are a prince of some great Russian house, Johnny, and I
      am nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I, Kitty? Less than nobody&mdash;a homeless outcast, with only
      you and Cutty. An American! Well, when I'm that it will be different; I'll
      be somebody. God forgive me if I do not give it absolute loyalty, this new
      country!... Never call me anything but Johnny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnny.&rdquo; Anywhere, whatever he willed her to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a child, Kitty. I want to grow up&mdash;if I can&mdash;to be an
      American, something like that ripping old thoroughbred yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cutty! Johnny wanted to be something like Cutty. Johnny would have to grow
      up to be his own true self; for nobody could ever be like Cutty. He was as
      high and far away from the average man as this apartment was from hers.
      Would he understand her attitude? Could she say anything until it would be
      too late for him to interfere? She was this man's woman. She would have
      her span of happiness, come ill, come good, even if it hurt Cutty, whom
      she loved in another fashion. But for Johnny dropping through that trap
      she might never have really known, married Cutty, and been happy. Happy
      until one or the other died; never gloriously, never furiously, but mildly
      happy; perhaps understanding each other far better than Johnny and she
      would understand each other. The average woman's lot. But to give her
      heart, her mind, her body in a whirlwind of emotions, absolute surrender,
      to know for once the highest state of exaltation&mdash;to love!
    </p>
    <p>
      All this tender exchange with half a dozen feet between them. Kitty had
      not stirred from the far side of the tea cart, and he had not opened his
      arms. She had given herself with magnificent abandon; for the present that
      satisfied her instincts. As for him, he was not quite sure this miracle
      might not be a dream, and one false move might cause her to vanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnny, who is Olga?&rdquo; The question was irrepressible. Perhaps it was the
      last shred of caution binding her. All of him or none of him. There must
      be no other woman intervening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawksley stiffened in his chair. His hands closed convulsively and his
      eyes lost their brightness. &ldquo;Johnny?&rdquo; Kitty ran round the tea cart. &ldquo;What
      is it?&rdquo; She knelt beside the chair, alarmed, for the horror had returned
      to his face. &ldquo;What did they do to you back there?&rdquo; She clasped one of his
      hands tensely in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my dreams at night!&rdquo; he said, staring into space. &ldquo;I could run away
      from my pursuers, but I could not run away from my dreams! Torches and
      hobnailed boots!... They trampled on her; and I, up there in the gallery
      with those damned emeralds in my hands! Ah, if I hadn't gone for them, if
      I hadn't thought of the extra comforts their sale would bring! There would
      have been time then, Kitty. I had all the other jewels in the pouch.
      Horses were ready for us to flee on, loyal servants ready to help us; but
      I thought of the drums. A few more worldly comforts&mdash;with hell
      forcing in the doors!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't tell her where I was going. When I came back it was to see her
      die! They saw me, and yelled. I ran away. I hadn't the courage to go down
      there and die with her! She thought I was in that hell pit. She went down
      there to die with me and died horribly, alone! Ah, if I could only shut it
      out, forget! Olga, my tender young sister, Kitty, the last one of my race
      I could love. And I ran away like a yellow dog, like a yellow dog! I don't
      know where her grave is, and I could not seek it if I did! I dared not
      write Stefani; tell him I had seen Olga go down under Karlov's heels, and
      then ran away!... Day by day to feel those stones against my heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is more terrible to a woman than the sight of a brave man weeping.
      For she knew that he was brave. The sudden recollection of the emeralds; a
      little more comfort for himself and sister if they were permitted to
      escape. Not a cowardly instinct, not even a greedy one; a normal desire to
      fortify them additionally against an unknown future, and he had
      surrendered to it impulsively, without explaining to Olga where he was
      going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnny, Johnny, you mustn't!&rdquo; She sprang up, seizing his head and wildly
      kissing him. &ldquo;You mustn't! God understands, and Olga. Oh, you mustn't sob
      like that! You are tearing my heart to pieces!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ran away like a yellow dog! I didn't go down there and die with her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't run away to-night when you offered your life for my liberty.
      Johnny, you mustn't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under her tender ministrations the sobs began to die away and soon
      resolved into little catching gasps. He was weak and spent from his
      injuries; otherwise he would not have given way like this, discovered to
      her what she had not known before, that in every man, however strong and
      valiant he may be, there is a little child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been burning me up, Kitty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know! It is because you have a soul full of beautiful things,
      Johnny. God held you back from dying with Olga because He knew I needed
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will marry me, knowing that I did this thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marry him! A door to some blinding radiance opened, and she could not see
      for a little while. Marry him! What a miserable wretch she was to think
      that he would want her otherwise! Johnny Two-Hawks, fiddling in front of
      the Metropolitan Opera House, to fill a poor blind man's cup!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Johnny. Now, yesterdays never were. For us there is nothing but
      to-morrows. Out there, in the great country&mdash;where souls as well as
      bodies may stretch themselves&mdash;we'll start all over again. You will
      be the cowman and I'll be the kitchen wench. As in the beginning, so it
      will always be hereafter, I'll cook your bacon and eggs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled his chair round and pushed it toward a window, dropped beside
      it and laid her cheek against his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us look at the stars, Johnny. They know.&rdquo; Kuroki, having arrived with
      coffee and sandwiches, paused on the threshold, gazed, wheeled right about
      face, and returned to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by Kitty looked up into Hawksley's face. He was asleep. She got up
      carefully, lightly kissed the top of his head&mdash;the old wound&mdash;and
      crossed to Cutty's door. She must tell dear old Cutty of the wonderful
      happiness that was going to be hers. She opened the study door, but did
      not enter at once. Asleep on his arms. Why, he hadn't even opened that Ali
      Baba's bag! Tired out&mdash;done in, as Johnny Two-Hawks called it in his
      English fashion. She waited; but as he did not stir she approached with
      noiseless step. The light poured full upon his head. How gray he was! A
      boundless pity surged over her that this tender, valiant knight should
      have missed what first her mother had known&mdash;now she herself&mdash;requited
      love. To have everything in the world without that was to have nothing.
      She would not wake him; she would let him sleep until Captain Harrison
      came. Lightly she touched the gray head with her lips and stole from the
      study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Molly, Molly!&rdquo; Cutty whispered into his rigid fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they were married, in the apartment, at the top of the world, on a
      May night thick with stars. It was not a wedding; it was a marriage. The
      world never knew because it was none of the world's business. Who was
      Kitty Conover? A nobody. Who was John Hawksley? Something to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the storm into the calm; which is something of a reversal.
      Generally in love affairs happiness is found in the approach to the
      marriage contract; the disillusions come afterward. It was therefore
      logical that Kitty and her lover should be happy, as they had run the
      gamut of test and fire beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young people were to leave for the West soon after the supper for
      three. At midnight Cutty's ship would be boring down the bay. Did Kitty
      regret, even a little, the rice and old shoes, the bridesmaids and cake,
      so dear to the female of the species? She did not. Did she think
      occasionally of the splendour of the title that was hers? She did. To her
      mind Mrs. John Hawksley was incomparably above and beyond anything in that
      Bible of autocracy&mdash;the Almanach de Gotha.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper Cutty brought in the old Amati.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play,&rdquo; he said, lighting his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Hawksley played&mdash;played as he never had played before and perhaps
      as he would never play again. We reach zenith sometimes, but we never stay
      there. But he was not playing to Cutty. Slate-blue eyes, two books with
      endless pages, the soul of this wife of his. He had come through. The
      miracle had been accomplished. Love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty smiled and smiled, the doors of her soul thrown wide to absorb this
      magic message. Love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutty smoked on, with his eyes closed. He heard it, too. Love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, sighing, &ldquo;I see innovations out there in Montana. The
      round-up will be different. The Pied Fiddler of Bar-K will stand in the
      corral and fiddle, and the bossies will come galloping in, two by two&mdash;and
      a few jackrabbits!&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;John, the Amati is yours conditionally.
      If after one year it is not reclaimed it becomes yours automatically. My
      wedding present. Remember, next winter, if God wills, you'll come and
      visit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if we could forget!&rdquo; cried Kitty, embracing Cutty, who accepted the
      embrace stoically. &ldquo;I'll be needing clothes, and Johnny will have to have
      his hair cut. Oh, Cutty, I'm so foolishly happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time we started for the choo-choo. Time-tables have no souls. But, Lord,
      what a racket we've had!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, rather!&rdquo;&mdash;from Hawksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bo, listen to me. Out there you must remember that 'bally' and 'ripping'
      and 'rather' are premeditated insults. Gee-whiz! but I'd like a look-see
      when you say to your rough-and-readies: 'Bally rotten weather. What?'
      They'll shoot you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More banter; which fooled none of the three, as each understood the other
      perfectly. The hour of separation was at hand, and they were fortifying
      their courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny old top,&rdquo; was Hawksley's comment as they stood before the train
      gate. &ldquo;Three months gone we were strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; began Cutty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With hoops of steel!&rdquo; interrupted Kitty. &ldquo;You must write, Cutty, and
      Johnny and I will be prompt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll get one from the Azores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Train going west!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck, children!&rdquo; Cutty pressed Hawksley's hand and pecked at Kitty's
      cheek. &ldquo;Shan't go through with you to the car. Kuroki is waiting.
      Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The redcaps seized the luggage, and Hawksley and his bride followed them
      through the gate. Because he was tall Cutty could see them until they
      reached the bumper. Funny old world, for a fact. Next time they met the
      wounds would be healed&mdash;Hawksley's head and old Cutty's heart. Queer
      how he felt his fifty-two. He began to recognize one of the truths that
      had passed by: One did not sense age if one ran with the familiar pack.
      But for an old-timer to jog along for a few weeks with youth! That was it&mdash;the
      youth of these two had knocked his conceit into a cocked hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear old Cutty!&rdquo; said Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old thoroughbred!&rdquo; said Hawksley.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there you were, relegated to the bracket where the family kept the
      kaleidoscope, the sea-shell, and the album. His children, though; from now
      on he would have that interest in life. The blessed infant&mdash;Molly's
      girl&mdash;taking a sunbonnet when she might have worn a tiara! And that
      boy, stepping down from the pomp of palaces to the dusty ranges of Bar-K.
      An American citizen. It was more than funny, this old top; it was stark
      raving mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he had one of the drums. It reposed in his wallet. Another queer
      thing, he could not work up a bit of the old enthusiasm. It was only a
      green stone. One of the finest examples of the emerald known, and he could
      not conjure up the panorama of murder and loot behind it. Possibly because
      he was no longer detached; the stone had entered his own life and touched
      it with tragedy. For it was tragedy to be fifty-two and to realize it.
      Thus whenever he took out the emerald he found his imagination walled in.
      Besides, it was a kind of magic mirror; he saw always his own tentative
      villainy. He was not quite the honest man he had once been.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was happening down the line there? The passengers were making way
      for someone. Kitty, and racing back to the gate! She did not pause until
      she stood in front of him, breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget something?&rdquo; he asked, awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uh-hm!&rdquo; Suddenly she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him. &ldquo;If
      only the three of us could be always together! Take care of yourself.
      Johnny and I need you.&rdquo; Then she caught his hand, gave it a pressure, and
      was off again. Cutty stood there, staring blindly in her direction. Old
      Stefani Gregor; sacrifice. By and by he became conscious of something warm
      and hard in his palm. He looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      A green stone, green as the turban of a Mecca pilgrim, green as the eye of
      a black panther in the thicket. He dropped the emerald into a vest pocket
      and fumbled round for his pipe&mdash;always his mental crutch. He lit it
      and marched out of the station into the night&mdash;chuckling
      sardonically. For the second time the thought occurred to him: Of all his
      earthly possessions he would carry into the Beyond&mdash;a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Molly, then Kitty; but the drums of jeopardy were his!

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
